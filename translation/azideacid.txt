The azido group can be reduced to an amino function and hereby serve as masked amino group. It is of particular use, if additional orthogonalities are needed. Azido is stable towards treatment with piperidine (Fmoc deprotection), Pd(0) (Alloc removal) and acidic treatmet (cleavage of Mtt, Trt or other acid sensitive groups). However, as it is a pseudohalogenide, care has to be taken during coupling steps, as HATU will cause high racemization. This can be avoided using collidine or other non-nucleophilic bases instead of DIPEA.
Certainly 2-amino-3-azidobutanoic acid can be used for any type of click conjugation with any available alkynyl residue forming Diels-Alder conjugates of peptides or any other organic molecule.
Chiral α,β-diamines and diamino acids have become an increasing targeted functional motif in organic synthesis owing to their ubiquity in natural products and medicinal agents. For example, it is found in biotin, penicillins, and antiinfluenza neuraminidase inhibitor Tamiflu. Chiral vicinal diamines and their metal complexes have been employed in stereoselective organic synthesis, in particular, as chiral auxiliaries and ligands in catalytic asymmetric synthesis.
