GMP Production process and repeated experience is readily available to supply this peptide API including all CMC documentation necessary for registration. TT-232 is a structural analogue of somatostatin, a hormone with significant, selective antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory and antisecretory properties. In contrast to the parent hormone and its �gtraditional�h analogues, this compound has strong and specific growth-inhibitory potential without the wide-ranging endocrine side-effects, including inhibition of insulin secretion provoking diabetes. Its mechanism of action is in line with a new era of molecular medicine called signal-transduction therapy, where "internal communication" of cells is corrected without interfering with basic cell functions and machinery.

The therapeutic potential of Thymosin a1 and its sub-structural peptide fragments is in prevention of opportunistic infections  after chemo- and X-ray therapy.  Thymosin a1 is approved in over 30 countries for the treatment of Hepatitis B and C, and it is also approved for inclusion with vaccines to boost  the immune response in the treatment of other diseases. It furthermore can be used in treating infections after different cancer therapies, wound healing and cosmetics.  Bis-Thymosin-a1 is a dimer with much higher efficacy. Increased bioavailability, lower doses combined with lower administration frequency leads to an increased drug therapeutic  index.  Thymosin a1 and substructures can also be used in wound healing and skin care.

Orexin A (hypocretin-1) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide regulating the feeding behavior. Central administration of orexin A to rats stimulated food consumption in a dose-dependent  manner. The effect persisted at 4 h after injection, as orexin A seems to be resistant to peptidases. Orexin A specifically binds a G protein-coupled receptor, OX1R (IC50 = 20 nM  to displace 50 % of radiolabeled orexin A bound to this receptor). Orexin A produced in the amygdala induces wakefulness and plays a role in the induction of human emotions.  Narcolepsy has been associated with orexin deficiency.

An irreversible, highly selective cysteine protease inhibitor. Shows no inhibition against serine proteases with an except of trypsin. Interacts with the Sn subsites of proteases.  For in vivo studies the use of E-64 as a cysteine protease inhibitor is highly recommanded because it has a specific inhibition, it is permeable in cells and tissues and has low  toxicity. Inhibits activation-induced programmed cell death and restores defective immune responses in HIV+ donors  Potential targets: Papain, Bromelain, Ficin, Cathepsin B, H and L, Tumor-Cathepsin, Calpain     References:  K.

A potent, reversible inhibitor of serine and cysteine proteases. It showed little to no inhibition activity against: pepsin, cathepsins A and D and alpha-chymotrypsin. All three  salt forms are equally effective, when adjusted to their molarity.  Potential targets: Calpain, Plasmin, Trypsin, Papain, Cathepsin B, H, L, Kallikrein, Thrombin  References:  J. H.

A potent, reversible, highly selective Inhibitor for acid proteases (aspartate proteases). Has shown to inhibit HIV and MMTV proteases and no activity against thiol proteases.  Pepstatin is little toxic.  Potential targets: Pepsin, Renin, Cathepsin D, Chymosin, Protease B, retroviral Proteases  References:  T. Munkhjargal, M. AbouLaila, M. A. Terkawi, T. Sivakumar, M.

Triphenylphosphonium (TPP) RGD peptide has the ability to transport drugs to mitochondria that are otherwise cell impermeable. Hence it can be used as drug delivery shuttle to treat mitochondrial targets.  Reference: Multiple Triphenylphosphonium Cations Shuttle a Hydrophilic Peptide into Mitochondria; Shareefa E.
