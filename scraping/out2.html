Human tissue has been collected and stored at institutions in the United States for more than 100 years. Each of these institutions, or repositories, was established to meet a specific set of objectives, and its design is integrally linked to those objectives. Tissue collection, proc- essing, and storage techniques vary depending on the purpose of the repository, as do the quality and extent of information collected with the biospecimens.
Over the last year, the National Biospecimen Network (NBN) Design Team, a subset of the Tissue Access Working Group (TAWG) convened by the National Dialogue on Cancer (NDC) to address “access to appropriately collected, consented, and annotated tissue,” has been drafting a blueprint for a national biospecimen net- work. The overall goal of the TAWG is to establish a national, pre-competitive, regulatory compliant and genetic-privacy protected, standardized, inclusive, highest quality network of biological sample(s) banks; developed in partnerships with and supported by cancer survivors/advocates; shared, readily accessible, and searchable using appropriate in- formatics systems (e.g., amenable to molecular profiling capability).
To assist in its examination of existing tissue resources, the NBN Design Team requested that the RAND Corporation conduct case studies of existing human tissue resources to evaluate their utility for genomics- and proteomics-based cancer research and that RAND identify “best practices” at these institutions. This report presents the
RAND findings for each repository evaluated and identifies best prac- tices that can be used by the TAWG in its strategic planning process for the development of a new NBN.

The National Dialogue on Cancer (NDC) is a forum that brings to- gether representatives from the private sector, academia, non-profit organizations, and government agencies to accelerate progress against cancer. At a March 2002 meeting of the NDC Research Team, “access to appropriately collected, consented, and annotated tissue” was identified as a critical barrier to developing genomics- and pro- teomics-based therapies. Following this meeting, the Tissue Access Working Group (TAWG) was formed to address this barrier.
The TAWG first met in August 2002 and concluded that the development of a national tissue resource and data bank was neces- sary if the nation was to ultimately realize the promise of genomics and proteomics for preventing and curing cancer as well as a range of other diseases. The overall goal of the TAWG is to establish a national, pre-competitive, regulatory compliant and genetic-privacy protected, standardized, inclusive, highest quality network of biological sample(s) banks; developed in partnerships with and supported by cancer survivors/advocates; shared, readily accessible, and searchable using appropriate in- formatics systems (e.g., amenable to molecular profiling capabil- ity).
Over the last year, a subset of the TAWG, the National Bio- specimen Network (NBN) Design Team, has been drafting a strate- gic plan—the NBN Design and Engineering Blueprint—that identi-
fies the key goals and characteristics of a new NBN. In conjunction with its development of the blueprint, the NBN Design Team recog- nized that it was important to evaluate existing tissue resources. To assist in its examination of existing tissue resources, the team re- quested that RAND conduct case studies of existing human tissue resources to evaluate their utility for genomics- and proteomics-based cancer research and that RAND identify “best practices” at these institutions.
This report presents the findings for twelve repositories in the United States that represent a broad spectrum of repository types. Interviews were conducted at each repository with key individuals who were asked questions about repository design; the bioinformatics system; privacy, ethical, and legal issues; and public relations and marketing. The interviews focused on the identification of best prac- tices, including innovative strategies, systems and processes pertaining to specimen and data collection, storage and distribution, bioinfor- matics systems, and informed consent. This report identifies best practices that can be used by the TAWG in its strategic planning process for the development of a robust resource for genomics- and proteomics-based research that will fulfill the needs of the research community.
Each of the repositories evaluated for this study was established and designed to meet specific objectives. Thus, each repository’s design is integrally linked to its objectives. Biospecimen collection, processing, and storage techniques vary depending on the purpose of the reposi- tory. Likewise, the quality and extent of information collected with the specimens vary depending on the purpose for which the tissue was originally collected. The type of informed consent—whether general surgical consent or specific informed consent for the use of the biospecimen for research purposes—also varies from repository to repository, sometimes limiting the usefulness of some specimens for certain kinds of research.
While all repositories evaluated for this study have one or more of the features identified by the NBN Design Team as components of a new NBN, none has all of the characteristics identified as necessary for a successful NBN. Some repositories have several of the needed characteristics; others have only a few.
Complicating matters is the fact that there are currently no na- tional standards for tissue repositories that collect and store specimens for research use.1 Therefore, the way one repository collects, proc- esses, and stores its specimens may be very different from the way an- other repository does, which may complicate comparisons of research results obtained using biospecimens from different repositories. Furthermore, once samples are distributed to researchers, most reposito- ries do not require those researchers to report their research results back to the repository, and even fewer repositories enter those research results into their bioinformatics systems and make them avail- able to the broader research community.
The NBN Design Team recognized the limitations of existing repositories and decided to design a new kind of repository. The team envisions a network of geographically dispersed tissue repositories to collect, process, store, and distribute appropriately consented diseased and normal tissue and other biological specimens with associated clinical data supported and coordinated by an accessible, user-friendly bioinformatics system networked across the country. The biospeci- mens would be collected, processed, annotated, stored, and distrib-
Professional societies, such as the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories (ISBER) and the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS), have recognized the need for standardization and are developing guidance for establishing and operating biospecimen repositories. ISBER is creating a set of Best Practices for Repositories to provide repository professionals with guidance on repository activities. The NCCLS guidelines will cover all health care institutions and clinics that collect human tissue for research purposes, and will provide standards for addressing all issues associated with the collection of human tissue to support biomedical research, including the ethical, legislative, and legal concerns.
uted in a highly standardized manner to minimize experimental vari- ability and accelerate scientific progress. The NBN would also archive research data submitted by investigators who were using NBN sam- ples and would promote data sharing and meta-analysis.
The network of geographically dispersed tissue repositories that the NBN Design Team envisions for collecting, processing, annotat- ing, storing, and distributing tissue is very similar to how some of the repositories evaluated for this study are set up. The Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN), the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN), the Breast and Ovarian Cancer Family Registries (CFRs) (of which the Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry is a member), and the University of Pittsburgh Health Sciences Tissue Bank (HSTB) are all variations of the model of decentralized resources deployed through a virtual network of geographically dispersed tissue centers coordinated and supported by a centralized bioinformatics and data management system networked across the country. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Biological Specimen Repository, the Armed Forces Institute of Pa- thology (AFIP) National Pathology Repository, Ardais Corporation, and Genomics Collaborative, Inc. (GCI) have a decentralized collec- tion model but maintain their storage and distribution of specimens and their bioinformatics system at one physical location. The Tissue Array Research Program (TARP) also has a decentralized collection model with the bioinformatics system and storage maintained at one physical location; however, its tissue microarrays are distributed by the CHTN. In contrast, the Duke University Breast Specialized Pro- gram of Research Excellence (SPORE), the Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Breast and Ovarian SPOREs have centralized collection, storage, distribu- tion, and bioinformatics systems and data management. Based on its evaluation of these twelve existing human tissue resources, RAND came up with several best practices that the NBN Design Team and NDC may want to consider as they implement their plan for the NBN.
Best practices for biospecimen collection that will increase the quan- tity and variety of high-quality samples available to researchers, while maintaining appropriate normal controls, include establishing a net- work of collection sites at academic medical centers and community hospitals, and collecting tissues from a broad range of diseases, non- diseased matching adjacent tissue, normal tissue, and other biological specimens (e.g., whole blood, serum, and plasma). It is also important that tissue be collected from ethnically diverse populations of all ages to ensure that the tissue available for research purposes is diverse and demographically representative of the population, and to expand biomedical research to include understudied/underrepresented popu- lations and the study of health disparities.
The prioritization of patient diagnosis over collection of speci- mens for research purposes is key to ensuring that patient care is not compromised and that patients continue to donate biospecimens. Pathologists at the collection site play an important role in the initial procurement of the specimen for the repository, and repository pathologists are central to the quality control procedures for verifica- tion and evaluation of the specimen. In addition, repository-trained personnel using standard operating procedures and standard collec- tion and processing equipment are important to promoting stan- dardized tissue collection and processing.
Best practices for data collection depend on the mission of the repository. However, no matter what the requirements for the amount of associated data are, certain best practices are applicable. It is important to collect consistent and high-quality data associated with biospecimens and to employ a standardized set of common data elements that are collected with every biospecimen. It is also impor- tant to define the data set that is optimal for fulfilling the mission of the repository and the needs of its customers, and to collect the data (such as demographic and pathologic data, family history, medical history, lifestyle and diet history, treatment history, and clinical out- comes) required to meet those needs.
Once data are collected, they must be entered into the reposi- tory’s bioinformatics system. The use of common data elements and standardized terminology for data collection procedures allows the use of standardized data-entry forms with features that minimize the errors introduced while typing information into forms. In addition, scannable bar codes are used to track biospecimens and associated information throughout their lifetime at the repository. Parsing tech- niques are used to flag discrepancies and to record errors and their reconciliation. The use of standardized terminology and computer data entry forms, scannable bar codes, and data reconciliation tech- niques are best practices that ensure data accuracy.
Standards for storage depend on tissue type and preservation condition (e.g., snap frozen, paraffin embedded, tissue microarray). Snap-frozen specimens are commonly stored at –80°C in mechanical freezers or in liquid nitrogen. Paraffin-embedded tissue and tissue mi- croarrays are stored at room temperature or in a climate-controlled environment to protect them from melting or other damage. How- ever, there is no consensus on the optimum storage conditions for specimens.
Once specimens are placed in storage, it is necessary to monitor storage conditions and maintain equipment. Standard operating pro- cedures for freezer maintenance, adequate backup equipment, and redundancy in storage location are best practices for ensuring that specimens are stored and maintained at the necessary temperature and condition and that specimen integrity is not compromised. Peri- odic auditing, inventories, and certification of the location, identity, and quality of specimens ensure the quality and integrity of samples sent to researchers. Bar coded inventory systems are used to track specimen storage location.
Standardized and carefully monitored shipping procedures track all shipments in and out of a repository. Biospecimens sent to a re- pository from remote/satellite collection sites and samples sent from that repository to researchers are tracked using electronic technolo- gies, such as bar coded inventory systems or smart chips and radio- frequency identification tags.
Specimen distribution practices clearly depend on the mission of the repository. If the mission is to provide tissue samples to as broad a base of researchers as possible based on the quality of the proposed research, then biospecimen distribution policies should be established to fulfill this mission. If the mission is clearly defined, and if the re- pository evaluates its ability to meet its goals and changes its policies, procedures, and practices when not meeting those goals, then this is a best practice.
Quality assurance is fundamental to the successful operation of any biospecimen repository. The use of standardized protocols for collection, storage, processing, and distribution of specimens, and the use of common data elements for the annotation of specimens at each of the individual network participant locations make comparative re- search across participating institutions possible. To ensure that the collection, processing, annotation, storage, and distribution of bio- specimens occur at a consistently high level of quality, it is necessary to have a multitiered, fully integrated quality assurance system and standard operating procedures. Quality assurance starts with the training of personnel before biospecimens are ever collected and in- cludes everything up through considering researcher feedback on sample quality.
The backbone of any repository is a standardized, scalable, and secure bioinformatics system that is appropriate for repository management, tissue acquisition and management, and data aggregation and analy- sis. Bioinformatics systems are used for repository management, clinical and pathological data management, collection and analysis of research results, and data mining and advanced statistical analysis to identify patterns and establish relationships. A bioinformatics system that is searchable and minable via varying levels of Web-based access for different individuals—including repository personnel, researchers, patients, and the public—is a best practice. Robust network security
The use of a standardized language to categorize and describe biospecimens and enter data into the bioinformatics system is essen- tial for comparison of biospecimen characteristics among collection sites. In addition to using a standardized language, it is also important to use either a system that can automatically extract data from medi- cal records or multiple checks of data entry to ensure the accuracy of the data in the bioinformatics system.
A repository is successful only if it is meeting user needs, and its suc- cess can only be determined through continual self-assessment and re- evaluation. Meeting user needs may require different approaches de- pending on the repository’s design, customer profile, and product offerings. Assessing the needs of researchers, tracking the numbers and types of tissue samples distributed, and using this information to determine whether the resource is continuing to meet researchers’ needs or whether changes need to be made constitute a best practice.
The review and prioritization system for tissue distribution gen- erally falls into one of four general categories: (1) first come, first served; (2) priority to members of the network, collaborators, and/or contributors to the repository; (3) prioritization based on merit re- view of research proposals; or (4) prioritization based on a set policy of the repository. Best practices to ensure equitable distribution of tissue to the broadest group of researchers possible include (a) the use of a tissue utilization committee to prioritize tissue distribution based on merit review of researcher proposals, and (b) policies to control
the distribution of rare specimens, to control the last sample of a par- ticular specimen, and to prevent the control of an entire specimen or type of specimen by one researcher. Giving priority to researchers at collecting institutions is also a best practice, one that leads to more support for the resource and higher investment in the quality of the specimens collected.
Committees or review groups in which both providers and con- sumers are able to provide input on the usefulness of the repository resources are valuable in evaluating how well the repository meets user needs. In addition, solicitation of feedback on sample quality directly from researchers who are using the samples helps to identify systemic problems, inconsistencies, or problems with the specimens in the repository or specimens being collected in a certain way or from a certain collection site. These best practices enable re- positories to improve specimen quality and to be responsive to re- searcher needs.
Repositories are generally funded by four different sources: the federal government, academia, private industry, and private non-profit. Re- positories also follow different business models, including tissue banking versus prospective collection and distribution, networks ver- sus individual sites, and centralized versus decentralized collection, storage, and bioinformatics systems. Establishing a network of collec- tion sites at academic medical centers and community hospitals to perform a combination of banking to collect and maintain a ready supply of tissue and prospective collection to meet researcher needs is a best practice.
When approaching a medical facility about becoming a partici- pating collection site, it is often more productive to start discussions with the pathologists and surgeons rather than with hospital adminis- trators. Once a relationship has been established at a collection site, it is vital to maintain close working relationships with surgeons,
At the repositories evaluated, the cost per specimen to collect, process, store, and distribute was variable (between $60 and $150 per specimen at the repositories able to provide estimates) and depended on the amount of clinical information accompanying the biospeci- men—the more information, the higher the cost of collecting the tis- sue and associated data. The cost of samples to researchers ranged from free of charge to $200 or higher depending on the type of sam- ple obtained, the level of annotation associated with the sample, and whether the researcher was from an academic institution or industry. Accurately determining the actual costs of collecting, processing, storing, and distributing tissue samples, and operating on a cost re- covery basis to financially sustain the repository constitute a best practice.
Continually assessing new technologies and taking measures to develop and incorporate new technologies into the repository are nec- essary for any system to be forward thinking, capable of expansion, and flexible as researchers’ needs change. This is usually accomplished through regular meetings with staff to brainstorm about ways to ad- dress and incorporate new technologies, in combination with more formal mechanisms, such as committees or workshops established to purposefully scan for improvements and new technologies. Requiring acknowledgment in publications for the use of repository resources, including specific language for such acknowledgment, is a best prac- tice because it raises the visibility of the resource and may encourage future donations and use of the resource. It also allows the tracking of scientific accomplishments made possible by the availability of speci- mens from the resource.
Institutional review boards ( IRBs) are responsible for the oversight and review of research that involves human participants to ensure that their privacy is protected and confidentiality of data is maintained. Requiring repositories to have IRB approval for the collection, stor- age, and distribution of biospecimens and associated data, and requiring researchers requesting samples to have IRB approval of re- search projects that will use the samples are essential for protecting privacy and confidentiality. In addition, convening a bioethics advi- sory board or other governance and oversight board/committee to oversee privacy and confidentiality procedures provides another layer of review. Limiting access to the codes that link patient identifying information to the sources of the tissue specimens through physical and/or cyber procedures to minimize the chance of identifying in- formation being released is also a best practice to protect privacy and confidentiality.
Obtaining biospecimens from individuals who are fully in- formed about and have consented to the collection of their tissue by the repository and its use for research purposes is a best practice. Using a tiered consent process that allows individuals to choose the type of specimen(s), if any, they want to donate (e.g., tissue, blood, or urine), the type of research the specimen can be used for (e.g., a spe- cific research project, general research, or genetic research), and whether their medical records and outcomes data can be accessed is also a best practice. Ideally, the consent process should occur sepa- rately from the surgical consent. However, since this is not always possible, at a minimum the informed consent for the collection and research use of specimens should be a separate section of the surgical consent form that requires a separate signature.
Individuals who contribute biospecimens must have the right to withdraw their consent and have their tissue removed from the re- pository. However, once the tissue has been stripped of identifiers so that the link back to the identity of the tissue source has been de- stroyed, it is not possible to identify the tissue to withdraw it from the repository. Beyond the right to withdraw their consent and their tissue from the repository, tissue sources are given no other rights to their tissues by most repositories. It is a best practice to allow an indi- vidual who contributes tissue to a repository to withdraw consent and have the tissue, data, and computer records removed from the reposi- tory if the tissue retains identifiers to link it to that individual and it has not been distributed to researchers.
Most repositories do not retain downstream rights to any intel- lectual property produced through the use of the tissues they distrib- ute. In most cases, institutions that contribute biospecimens to the repository give up their rights to the biospecimens as well. However, some contributing institutions are given priority for tissue requests. In the interest of being clear and to avoid conflicts with tissue sources, researchers using the tissue, or institutions contributing bio- specimens, it is a best practice to use a specific published policy on intellectual property. Another best practice is to prioritize tissue dis- tribution based on need while reserving a small percentage of tissue for contributing institutions participating in the repository.
Requiring researchers to sign an agreement that covers the legal issues associated with the use of biospecimens is a best practice. The tissue use agreement should contain language to the effect that the specimens will be used only for the purposes cited in the application, no attempt to obtain identifying information will be made, no speci- mens will be sold or shared with a third party without the prior writ- ten permission of the repository, all specimens will be treated as po- tentially infectious, all personnel who will be handling the specimens will be properly trained, there is no implied warranty on the speci- mens, any publications resulting from the use of repository specimens will acknowledge the repository, and the researcher/institution using
the tissue assumes responsibility for all risks associated with the re- ceipt, handling, storage, and use of the tissue.
The matter of liability with respect to safety issues associated with the use of the specimens, loss of privacy or breach of confiden- tiality of tissue sources, claims by tissue sources of physical/ psychosocial harms, or claims of tissue sources to property rights for discoveries made using their tissues is a major concern to repositories. Therefore, it is important to explicitly specify the responsibility for assuming risks in connection with use of biospecimens, to fully in- form tissue sources about risks to their rights and welfare, and to clarify ownership issues in tissue use agreements and during the informed consent process. Similarly, it is a best practice to carefully review researchers’ submissions and credentials to ensure that tissue is being used by legitimate researchers for legitimate purposes. This re- view should include the inspection of IRB documentation, review of the study design for which the samples will be used, and verification that the researcher requesting samples is associated with a legitimate research institution.
Public relations, marketing, and education are critical to the success of any tissue repository. Utilizing a combination of approaches to publicize the resources available at the repository—including exhibits at scientific meetings, advertising in scientific journals, newsletters, Web sites, direct mailings, and word of mouth—is a successful way to increase the visibility of the repository, its resources, and its mission. Although not widely done today, a best practice for repositories is to provide feedback to tissue sources, physicians, and researchers through scientific and patient workshops that report generalized re- search findings, by disseminating research news and patient education information on a Web site, by sending newsletters to tissue sources and researchers summarizing research with repository resources, or through other outreach venues.
Each of the repositories evaluated in this study was designed accord- ing to a specific vision, which was not necessarily the same as the vision of the NBN Design Team. Due to these different visions, none of the repositories in this report exhibits all of the elements identified as important by the NBN Design Team for the proposed NBN. However, in most cases the repositories are flexible and, with appro- priate funding and guidelines, have the potential to be an integral part of the NBN. In fact, this study revealed that most of the reposi- tories have undergone a significant learning curve and that their cur- rent successes are based on years of experience and learning from early operations. This wealth of experience should not be overlooked as NDC goes forward with its plan to establish a new NBN.
All of the repositories evaluated exhibit some characteristics that would be useful for an NBN, but some of the repositories incorporate more of the NBN Design Team requirements than others do. CHTN, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI have sev- eral of the characteristics identified by the NBN Design Team as nec- essary for a successful NBN. CHTN is a virtual network with the proven ability to distribute tens of thousands of biospecimens in a variety of forms (e.g., fresh, snap frozen, and paraffin embedded) to meet researchers’ needs. University of Pittsburgh HSTB has devel- oped a Web-based bioinformatics system that includes proteomics and genomics information and is already being used in Pennsylvania to create a virtual network of repositories. Ardais and GCI, the two private companies in this study, have streamlined specimen collec- tion, processing, storage, and distribution through specific standard operating procedures, and they both minimize operator and data en- try errors through the use of bar-code systems.
Other repositories only have a few of the key components of the proposed NBN. For example, TARP develops and disseminates tissue microarrays for high-throughput screening of multiple tumor tissues (300 to 500 tissues per array). EDRN requires that specimens be col- lected, processed, and annotated in a standardized manner and that a set of common data elements be collected with each specimen. Phila-
delphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry also uses common data ele- ments, and it routinely collects longitudinal data. The SPOREs at Duke University, the Mayo Clinic, and UAB routinely collect de- tailed clinical information and longitudinal data.
Whether NDC decides to fulfill the NBN goal by building a brand new repository or by using existing repositories in the devel- opment of a national network, learning from the existing repositories will be an important step. This report identifies the best practices at twelve biospecimen repositories in the United States. As the NBN gets under way, more detailed analyses of existing biospecimen reposi- tories and the inclusion of key personnel from existing repositories will be warranted.

Human tissue has been stored for more than 100 years in the United States. An earlier RAND study conservatively estimated that there were more than 307 million tissue specimens from more than 178 million cases stored in the United States, accumulating at a rate of more than 20 million specimens per year (Eiseman and Haga, 1999). These tissue specimens are stored at military facilities, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its sponsored facilities, other federal agencies, state collection agencies (e.g., state forensic DNA banks and newborn screening laboratories), diagnostic pathology and cytology laboratories, university- and hospital-based research laboratories, commercial enterprises, and non-profit organizations. These tissue collections vary considerably, ranging from formal repositories to the informal storage of blood or tissue specimens in a researcher’s freezer, and range in size from fewer than 200 to more than 92 million specimens.
The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) National Pa- thology Repository, the single largest tissue repository in the world, stores more than 92 million specimens. The tissue repositories sup- ported by NIH are not as large as those at AFIP, but NIH is probably the largest funding source for tissue repositories. For instance, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) alone supports several major tissue resources, including the Cooperative Human Tissue Network
Case Studies of Existing Human Tissue Repositories
(CHTN), the Clinical Trials Cooperative Group Human Tissue Re- sources, the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN), the Cancer Family Registries (CFRs) for Breast and Ovarian Cancer and Colo- rectal Cancer, and the Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs). The pathology departments at academic medical centers and community hospitals collectively constitute the largest and some of the oldest stores of biospecimens in the United States, with some specimens more than a century old. Finally, several private-sector companies maintain tissue banks for proprietary use, and others maintain banks for storage and distribution purposes.
The vast majority of tissue was originally collected for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons. Tissue specimens are also taken during autop- sies performed to establish the cause of death. This tissue, which is largely stored at clinical and diagnostic laboratories and similar facili- ties, is sometimes used for research, educational, and quality control purposes, but the vast majority of it is not. Repositories have also been established specifically for research. In addition, several very large longitudinal studies collect and bank specimens from their study participants. Likewise, a fair amount of research simultaneously cre- ates tissue collections or contributes to tissue banks. Other than for diagnostic purposes or research use, tissue is collected and stored for a variety of reasons, including blood transfusions, organ transplanta- tion, procreative purposes (i.e., at sperm and embryo banks), identifi- cation (e.g., paternity testing, cases of abduction, or soldiers missing in action), and forensic purposes in criminal investigations.
Each institution that collects and stores human tissue was established to fulfill a specific set of objectives, and the design of each of these repositories is integrally linked to those objectives. Tissue collection, processing, and storage techniques vary depending on the purpose of the repository. For example, pathology laboratories that collect tissue from patients undergoing surgical or diagnostic proce- dures routinely store tissue in paraffin blocks, while some tissue col- lections established as part of research protocols are composed en- tirely of snap-frozen specimens. In addition, tissue specimens can be processed and stored in other formats, such as thin sections mounted on slides, cell cultures, or extracted DNA or RNA, depending on
their intended use. Likewise, the quality and extent of information collected with the specimens can vary depending on the purpose for which the tissue was originally collected. Some repositories collect only pathologic characterizations of collected tissues; others collect extensive family histories and longitudinal data. The type of informed consent—whether general surgical consent or specific informed con- sent for the use of tissue for research purposes—also varies from repository to repository.
Many of the older repositories are valuable because of both the magnitude of their collections and the wealth of information they have collected about the specimens, information that may allow in- vestigators to ascertain changes over time as environmental or societal shifts occur. However, these specimens may be of limited use for cer- tain types of genomics- and proteomics-based research due to their age and/or the method in which they were stored (e.g., paraffin em- bedded instead of snap frozen). In addition, the lack of nationally agreed-upon quality control and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the collection and storage of tissue may limit the useful- ness of existing tissue collections for research requiring highly stan- dardized specimen collection and preparation.
The National Dialogue on Cancer (NDC) is a forum that brings to- gether representatives from the private sector, academia, non-profit organizations, and government agencies to foster and support efforts to “eradicate cancer as a major public health problem at the earliest possible time.” A March 2002 meeting of the NDC Research Team was convened to explore approaches to optimize and accelerate the development of genomics- and proteomics-based diagnostics, treat- ments, and prevention strategies for cancer. Participants at this meeting identified “access to appropriately collected, consented, and annotated tissue” as a critical barrier to developing genomics-based therapies. Following this meeting, the Tissue Access Working Group (TAWG)—a self-selected group of individuals from the cancer re-
search, drug development, delivery, commercialization, and patient advocacy sectors—was formed to address key barriers to biospecimen access.
The TAWG first met in August 2002 and concluded that the development of a national tissue resource and data bank was neces- sary if the nation was to ultimately realize the promise of genomics and proteomics for preventing and curing cancer as well as a range of other diseases. To help frame the issues at the August 2002 meeting, the TAWG reviewed the RAND Corporation’s Handbook of Human Tissue Sources: A National Resource of Human Tissue Samples (Eiseman and Haga, 1999). The TAWG also discussed ways to include and utilize the valuable and available resources of currently existing bio- specimen repositories described in the RAND report.
The TAWG, informed by several sources, including the United Kingdom’s National Cancer Research Institute report entitled Strate- gic Framework for Establishing a National Cancer Tissue Resource for Cancer Biology and Treatment Development, and information from private tissue acquisition companies, identified the key goals and characteristics of a new model for a national biospecimen network (NBN). The overall goal of the TAWG is
to establish a national, pre-competitive, regulatory compliant and genetic-privacy protected, standardized, inclusive, highest quality network of biological sample(s) banks; developed in partnerships with and supported by cancer survivors/advocates; shared, readily accessible, and searchable using appropriate in- formatics systems (e.g., amenable to molecular profiling capabil- ity).
A subset of the TAWG, the NBN Design Team, is currently in the process of developing a strategic plan—the NBN Design and Engineering Blueprint—to develop and implement the goals of the TAWG for a new NBN. In developing its blueprint, the team recog- nized that it was important to evaluate existing tissue resources to de- termine if any of them have the key characteristics of the NBN as de- fined by the TAWG, to identify “best practices” employed by existing repositories, and to assess whether any of these resources could be
adapted to fulfill the requirements of the proposed NBN. To assist in their examination of existing tissue resources, the NBN Design Team requested that RAND conduct case studies of existing human tissue resources to evaluate their utility for genomics- and proteomics-based cancer research and that RAND identify “best practices” at these institutions.
The purpose of the RAND study was to evaluate existing human tis- sue resources for their utility for genomics- and proteomics-based cancer research and to identify “best practices” at these institutions. Results of this study will be used to inform the NDC TAWG’s stra- tegic planning process to help guide the development of a new model for an NBN that will fulfill the needs of the research community.
RAND evaluated existing human tissue resources at twelve tissue re- positories in the United States that represent a broad spectrum of re- pository types. The repositories were selected to represent resources funded primarily by the federal government or the private sector and are located at federal agencies, academic institutions, and private companies. Some of the repositories selected for evaluation contain specimens collected for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes; others contain specimens collected specifically as part of clinical research. Detailed descriptions of the repositories included in this study can be found in Chapter Two in the Methodology section.
RAND developed an interview instrument that asked questions about repository design, the bioinformatics system, privacy, ethical and legal issues, and public relations and marketing (see Chapter Two). RAND collected background information on repositories of interest and conducted site visits and interviews of key repository per- sonnel. The interviews focused on the identification of best practices
at each repository evaluated, such as innovative strategies, systems, and processes pertaining to specimen and data collection, storage, and distribution, as well as to bioinformatics systems and informed con- sent.
Chapter Two describes the methodology used to select the reposito- ries to be evaluated and the development of the interview instrument. It also provides descriptions of each of the repositories evaluated for this study, and reasons why certain repositories were not included.
Chapter Three describes the various collection, processing, an- notation, storage, and distribution procedures utilized by the reposi- tories studied, plus their quality assurance, auditing, and standardized procedures. Chapter Four describes the bioinformatics and data man- agement procedures used at the repositories; Chapter Five discusses consumer/user needs; Chapter Six covers the business plan and opera- tions used by each repository; and Chapter Seven discusses privacy, ethical concerns, and consent issues that these repositories must ad- dress. Chapter Eight deals with intellectual property and other legal issues; and Chapter Nine describes public relations, marketing, and education efforts. Chapters Three through Nine also discuss and summarize best practices for each of these topics.
Chapter Ten details the RAND findings on best practices at each repository, as well as the best practices identified by RAND as necessary for establishing a national tissue resource and data bank to optimize and accelerate genomics- and proteomics-based research to develop diagnostics, treatments, and prevention strategies for cancer. The interview instrument is presented, in it entirety, in the Appendix.
RAND evaluated existing human tissue resources at several tissue re- positories in the United States chosen to represent a broad spectrum of repository types and allow the description of a wide array of best practices that might be used by the National Biospecimen Network (NBN). RAND identified these repositories in conjunction with the sponsor to meet the criteria described below.
The repositories were selected to represent resources funded pri- marily by the federal government or the private sector and are located at federal agencies, academic institutions, and private companies. They also represent a range of operating models:
Banking versus prospective collection and distribution
Extensive versus little or no clinical/longitudinal data
Networks versus individual sites
Centralized versus decentralized tissue storage and bioinfor- matics
Clinical trial/research participants (volunteers) versus patients not in clinical trials
Specimens collected for diagnostic or therapeutics purposes ver- sus specimens collected specifically for clinical research.
Repositories with important and unique collections or that are specifically involved in genomics/proteomics research were also se- lected.
RAND identified the responsible individuals to be interviewed at each site and contacted them. In the majority of cases, in-person in- terviews with key personnel were set up at the repositories. A few interviews were conducted over the phone, and in some instances (identified below), repositories declined to participate in the study.
The RAND team developed a standardized interview instru- ment (see Appendix) and received input on the draft from the NBN Blueprint Design Team. The original instrument was based in part on information found in the following four documents:
Meeting summary from the National Dialogue on Cancer Re- search Team Tissue Access Working Group Two-Day Strategy Meeting, Washington, D.C., August 26–27, 2002.
Meeting summary from the National Dialogue on Cancer Re- search Team Tissue Access Working Group Meeting, Washing- ton, D.C., January 7, 2003.
National Cancer Research Institute, “A Strategic Framework for Establishing a National Cancer Tissue Resource for Cancer Biol- ogy and Treatment Development,” by Kirstine Knox and Cathy Ratcliffe at the National Translational Cancer Research Network Coordinating Centre, September 2002.
The RAND report Handbook of Human Tissue Sources: A National Resource of Human Tissue Samples (Eiseman and Haga, 1999).
The interview instrument focused on the key characteristics for a new national tissue repository model identified by the NDC TAWG:
Biospecimen collection, processing, and storage
Bioinformatics and data management
Consumer/user needs
Business plan and operations
Privacy, ethical concerns, and consent issues
Intellectual property and legal issues
Public relations, marketing, and education.
The interviews asked about quality control, auditing, and stan- dardization in each of the areas listed above. The focus was on identi- fying best practices at each repository, such as innovative strategies, systems, and processes pertaining to specimen and data collection, storage, and distribution, and to bioinformatics systems and informed consent. The original interview instrument was modified slightly after input provided during initial interviews with Ardais and the Coopera- tive Human Tissue Network (CHTN).
In most cases, two members of the research team conducted each site visit and interview. Notes from each interview were then prepared and reviewed by the interviewers, and the interviewees were given an opportunity to comment on or correct any of the informa- tion documented from the interview. These notes were then pre- sented to the entire RAND research team for analysis. Following completion of the interviews, each section of the interview instru- ment was assigned to a RAND team member to analyze across the repositories and to identify best practices. Then a second team mem- ber evaluated this analysis as it related specifically to best practices.
It should be noted that the level of participation by the reposi- tory personnel interviewed varied significantly. RAND usually made the interview request to one of the principal individuals involved in the repository, and it was up to that person to include other reposi- tory personnel in the interview process. In some instances, RAND interviewed a wide range of those involved in the repository process (e.g., at Ardais and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center); in other instances, however, only one individual was interviewed (e.g., at Duke University Breast SPORE and Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE). Therefore, the level of detailed information provided by the reposito- ries was uneven in terms of the types and numbers of individuals who participated in the interview process. For example, often times there was no representation from the information technology side of the process, in which case the information provided by the repository principals on the bioinformatics system was usually quite generalized.
The repositories evaluated were grouped into three general categories. The first category, government, includes two repositories funded by and operated by federal agencies, one repository contracted by a fed- eral agency, and three repositories funded through Cooperative Agreements with a federal agency. The second category, academia, includes repositories at three major academic medical centers that are funded through Specialized Center Grants (P50s) from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and one repository at a major academic medical center that houses both NCI-funded resources and institute- funded programs. The third category, industry, includes two private companies that operate biospecimen repositories.
All of the repositories evaluated are summarized in Table 2.1 and described in detail, including their history, funding mechanism, and objectives, in the following subsections.
NCI at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports numerous tissue resources, including the NCI Cooperative Group Human Tissue Resources, CHTN, the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN), the Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs), and NCI intramural collections. The evaluation of NCI- supported tissue resources entailed gathering background information about all the tissue resources using the Internet and available litera- ture, performing site visits and interviews at representative reposito- ries (e.g., CHTN, EDRN, and the Tissue Array Research Program [TARP]), and interviewing key personnel involved in coordinating NCI’s cancer specimen resources.
Cooperative Human Tissue Network. Roger Aamodt, Ph.D., Chief, Resources Development Branch, Cancer Diagnosis Program, at NCI first developed the concept for a network that would supply human
tissue specimens for the conduct of basic and developmental cancer research in the mid-1980s. As a result, in 1987, CHTN was founded in response to a Request for Application (RFA) at three institutions under Cooperative Agreements with NCI. The University of Penn- sylvania/National Disease Research Interchange, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), and Ohio State University (OSU) constituted the initial network. The Children’s Cancer Study Group provided pediatric tumor specimens under a subcontract with OSU.
In January 1991, CHTN expanded to five divisions, including the direct funding of the Children’s Cancer Study Group as the CHTN Pediatric Division at the Children’s Hospital of Columbus, Ohio, and Case Western Reserve University. Currently, CHTN is made up of six divisions:
Eastern Division: University of Pennsylvania—responsible for the area of the northeast bounded by the western and southern bor- ders of Pennsylvania, as well as Delaware, Alaska, and Hawaii.
Mid-Atlantic Division: Medical Center University of Vir- ginia—responsible for Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.
Midwestern Division: Ohio State University—includes West Vir- ginia and states west of Pennsylvania north to Minnesota and south through Missouri, and Canada.
Southern Division: University of Alabama at Birming- ham—encompasses Kentucky and all states south and west from the Carolinas to Texas.
Western Division: Vanderbilt University Medical Center—covers all states north of Oklahoma and west of Texas.
Pediatric Division: Columbus Children’s Hospital—provides childhood tumors and diseased and normal tissue nationwide.
CHTN uses a prospective specimen procurement model to meet the needs of basic and developmental researchers. CHTN primarily collects and distributes surgical and autopsy specimens. These speci- mens are provided to researchers along with basic pathologic, his- tological, and demographic data. Dr. Aamodt and Marianna Bledsoe,
14 Case Studies of Existing Human Tissue Repositories
Program Director, Resources Development Branch, Cancer Diagno- sis Program, NCI, were interviewed about the practices and proce- dures of the overall network. Virginia LiVolsi, M.D., Principal Inves- tigator; Kelly Feil, Director; and Dee McGarvey, Manager, at CHTN Eastern Division, University of Pennsylvania, were interviewed specifically about the Eastern Division.
Tissue Array Research Program. In 1999, Richard Klausner, M.D., then Director of NCI, started to develop a research program that would utilize tissue microarray technology developed by Olli Kallioniemi and colleagues at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). TARP was conceived as a joint program (i.e., a collaborative effort) by NCI and NHGRI. NCI produced the tissue microarrays that were to be distributed extramurally by the Eastern Division of CHTN (see above for a description of CHTN), while NHGRI was to be responsible for development of the tissue microar- ray technology. Since that time, the NHGRI laboratory involved in developing tissue microarray technology has ceased to exist, and the TARP laboratory has expanded to produce and develop the technol- ogy. TARP was originally in the Office of the Director, NCI, but moved to the Centers for Cancer Research.
The primary objective of TARP is to develop and disseminate tissue microarrays containing samples of multiple tumors (300 to 500 tissues per array) to cancer researchers to expedite the discovery of novel cancer targets for the detection, treatment, and prevention of cancer. These microarrays provide a tool for high-throughput screen- ing of multiple tumor tissues with immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Stephen
M. Hewitt, M.D., Ph.D., Director of TARP at NCI, was inter- viewed.
Early Detection Research Network. EDRN was initiated by NCI in 1998 to improve methods for detecting the signatures of cancer cells. EDRN is funded through peer-reviewed Cooperative Agreements. It is a consortium for collaborative research to link the discovery of biomarkers directly to the next steps in the process of developing
early detection tests. This network brings together researchers across disciplines and institutions to identify, develop, and validate bio- markers. Network participants act as a team in a streamlined process through a distributed physical network of geographically dispersed repositories with a centralized bioinformatics and data management system. The network primarily consists of approximately 40 research universities but also includes more than a dozen private companies as industry partners. Sudhir Srivastava, Ph.D., M.P.H., Program Direc- tor of the EDRN Coordination Office; and Donald Johnsey, EDRN Information Technology Manager, were interviewed.
Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry. In 1995, the Philadel- phia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, part of the Breast and Ovarian Cancer Family Registries (CFRs),1 was established at the Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC) as part of a multisite/international breast cancer registry for familial breast cancer. It was created through a Cooperative Agreement with the NCI Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences. This grant was used by FCCC to build on a smaller registry designed to study breast cancer funded by the Department of Defense.
Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry is now one of six sites designed as a resource for breast and ovarian cancer research that includes extensive epidemiological medical data on breast and ovarian cancer patients and their family members; and biospecimens, includ- ing blood, and whenever possible, tumor specimens. Data are gath- ered longitudinally and placed in a central location at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) to make them available to the research com-munity. The six sites are:
Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry—at Fox Chase Cancer Center and the Coriell Institute for Medical Research.
Australian Breast Cancer Family Registry—at the University of Melbourne and the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute.
1 This was formerly called the Cooperative Family Registry for Breast Cancer Studies.
Metropolitan New York Registry of Breast Cancer Families—at the Joseph L. Mailman School of Public Health and Columbia University.
Northern California Cooperative Family Registry—at the North- ern California Cancer Center and Stanford University School of Medicine.
Ontario Registry for Studies of Familial Breast Cancer—at Cancer Care Ontario.
Utah Cooperative Breast Cancer Registry—at the Utah Health Sciences Center.
Biospecimen collection is handled at each CFR site. The Phila- delphia Familial Cancer Registry, Northern California Cooperative Family Registry, and Utah Cooperative Breast Cancer Registry all use the Coriell Cell Repositories (CCR) for storage. CCR stores several collections, most of which are sponsored by the federal government. Other sponsors include foundations and voluntary health organiza- tions. CCR receives blood, skin biopsies, and other tissue and estab- lishes viable, uncontaminated cell lines from them for distribution to the research community. CCR has transformed some of the lympho- cytes from the CFRs into cell lines to provide a perpetual source of DNA.
The grant was renewed in FY 2000 for a second five-year cycle. The six sites now focus on doing research as opposed to the initial focus on collecting the resource. Mary Daly, M.D., Ph.D., Principal Investigator of the Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, and Jeanne Beck, Ph.D., Professor at the Coriell Institute for Medical Re- search, Director of the Coriell Cell Repositories, were interviewed, the former in person and the latter by phone.
The NHLBI Biological Specimen Repository, established in 1974, contains over 3 million specimens available for use by researchers for studies related to transfusion-transmitted diseases, other blood disor- ders, lung diseases, and diseases of the cardiovascular system. The
NHLBI Biological Specimen Repository also contains clinical, epi- demiologic, virologic, and serologic information associated with the specimens.
BBI Biotech is under contract with NHLBI to store specimens for thirteen NHLBI studies, the largest one being the Retroviral Epi- demiological Study, which is geared around blood transfusions. BBI also stores specimens for the NHLBI-sponsored Lymphangioleio- myomatosis (LAM) Registry, which is a national registry of patients with LAM, a rare lung disease characterized by an unusual type of muscle cell that invades the tissue of the lungs, including the airways, and blood and lymph vessels. The LAM Registry is the only NHLBI collection that banks both blood and tissue specimens, including se- rum, plasma, RNA, DNA, and tissue. In addition to the collections held for NHLBI, BBI is storing specimens from approximately 700 different NCI studies and two Hepatitis C trials that are sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).
BBI was originally established in 1973 to provide a service to re- searchers running large trials involving specimen collection and specimen storage. It merged with Cambridge Biosciences to become BBI in 1992. BBI became the repository for NHLBI in 1998 after successfully winning a proposal solicitation. NCI has been using BBI to store specimens since 1973.
Kathi Shea, Director of Repository Operations, and Susan Sherer, Senior Study Coordinator, LAM Registry Data Coordinating Center, Cleveland Clinic, were interviewed, the former in person and the latter by e-mail. In addition, RAND evaluated the tissue reposi- tory at BBI and the practices and procedures of the NHLBI LAM study in particular.
The National Pathology Repository, located at AFIP (a tri-service agency of the Department of Defense), has the single largest and most comprehensive collection of pathology material in the world. Since 1864, this repository has collected more than 2.8 million cases com-
prising more than 50 million microscopic slides, 30 million paraffin tissue blocks, 12 million preserved wet tissue specimens, and associ- ated written records. The repository currently accessions approxi- mately 60,000 new cases per year representing both sexes, all races and ethnicities, and all ages from contributors worldwide.
AFIP was established at the end of the Civil War to examine battlefield specimens and as a medical museum. In 1943, AFIP’s main mission evolved from acting as a museum to serving as a pa- thology institute. Currently, AFIP primarily serves as a secondary re- ferral resource for expert diagnosis or confirmation of a diagnosis, al- though 25 percent of cases come to AFIP in need of an initial diagnosis. Included are veterinary pathology cases—animal tissue not previously reviewed by a veterinary pathologist. AFIP also receives thousands of special registry cases each year, including Persian Gulf War Illness, Prisoner of War, and cases sent from military hospitals closed in the base realignment and closure (BRAC) process. AFIP’s main purpose is to provide clinical diagnostic pathology support to the Armed Services, but it performs the same services for the civilian sector. Researchers at AFIP also perform long-term epidemiological research.
Francis Gannon, M.D., Chair of the Department of Repository and Research Services, and Chris Kelly, AFIP Public Affairs Director, were interviewed to evaluate the tissue resources at the AFIP National Pathology Repository.
NCI established the SPOREs in 1992. Their purpose is to “promote interdisciplinary research and to speed the bi-directional exchange between basic and clinical science to move basic research findings from the laboratory to applied settings involving patients and popula- tions” (SPORE Web site: http://spores.nci.nih.gov). SPOREs are funded through Specialized Center Grants (P50s). Currently, NCI is funding SPOREs on breast, ovarian, prostate, lung, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, brain, skin, head, and neck cancers, and lymphoma.
The goal of the SPOREs is “to bring to clinical care settings novel ideas that have the potential to reduce cancer incidence and mortality, improve survival, and to improve the quality of life.” The idea is to have basic researchers in the laboratories work with clinical scientists to conduct collaborative research in the areas of cancer pre- vention, detection, diagnosis, treatment, and control. As part of this effort, each SPORE establishes specialized resources, including tissue resource and bioinformatics cores.
Several SPOREs were chosen for inclusion in this study: the Duke University Breast SPORE, the Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, the Johns Hopkins University Lymphoma SPORE, and the Vanderbilt University Breast, Gastrointestinal, and Lung SPOREs. Interviews were conducted with individuals at the Duke University, the Mayo Clinic, and UAB responsible for managing the tissue re- source core for the SPOREs at their institutions. Brief descriptions of the SPOREs where interviews were conducted are directly below. An explanation for why some SPOREs initially selected for this study were not evaluated can be found in the next section of this chapter.
Duke University Breast SPORE. Duke University initially received funding for a Breast SPORE in 1995. It then lost funding for the SPORE in 2001 but was recently re-funded, in July 2003. The Tissue Resource Core is an integrated part of a pre-existing repository estab- lished by a molecular biology researcher and a surgeon in 1987. Jef- frey Marks, Ph.D., Associate Professor, Surgery, and co-creator of Duke University’s Breast Tissue Repository, was interviewed by phone about the Duke University Breast SPORE tissue resource.
Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE. Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE was es- tablished in 2001. The goal of the program is to identify genetic sus- ceptibility factors for prostate cancer that can improve the under- standing of the etiology of the disease and potentially identify men at increased risk of developing prostate cancer for whom prevention strategies might be targeted.
The Prostate Cancer Tissue Procurement Core of Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE is an integrated part of an ongoing program at the Mayo Clinic to collect, process, and store tissue from prostate cancer patients. The goal of the Tissue Procurement Core is to procure pros- tate tissue from every prostate cancer patient undergoing radical prostatectomy at the Mayo Clinic. The Tissue Procurement Core is also electronically integrated with the Prostate Cancer Patient Regis- try and the Biostatistics Core to provide investigators with clinically annotated specimens. Roxann Neuman, R.N., Urology Research Study Coordinator, was interviewed by phone about the Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE Tissue Procurement Core.
University of Alabama at Birmingham Breast and Ovarian SPOREs. The UAB Breast SPORE, established in 2001, is focused on the areas of breast cancer prevention, including genetics, chemoprevention, and therapy. The UAB Ovarian SPORE, established in 1999, is fo- cused on areas of gene therapy, targeted immunotherapy, and che- moprevention for ovarian cancer. Both SPOREs compliment ongo- ing programs at the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center in the areas of breast and ovarian cancer. UAB also has a newly funded Pancreatic SPORE. A Brain SPORE with an associated tissue resource is not associated with the breast, ovarian, and pancreatic tissue resources.
The UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs Tissue Resource Cores are integrated with pre-existing shared facilities at the UAB Compre- hensive Cancer Center. Since 1987, UAB has been a member of CHTN, serving as the Southern Division (see description of CHTN, above). Thus, UAB has extensive experience in collecting, processing, storing, and distributing a wide range of human tissue to support re- search. The goal of the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs Tissue Re- source Cores is to collect well-characterized breast and ovarian tumor specimens and matching adjacent specimens, along with clinical and demographic information, for use by SPORE members and by se- lected extramural users for special research purposes. William Grizzle, M.D., Ph.D., Principal Investigator of the Tissue Resources Core, was interviewed by phone about the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs tissue resources.
The Health Sciences Tissue Bank (HSTB) at the University of Pitts- burgh initially started banking tissues as a resource for researchers at the university, but the program has grown to include NCI-funded resources (the Cooperative Prostate Cancer Tissue Resource [CPCTR], an EDRN Gastrointestinal grant, and a Lung SPORE), and institute-funded programs (a melanoma banking program and a cancer biomarkers laboratory). HSTB also prospectively banks a vari- ety of neoplasms, with special emphasis in the areas of breast, lung, urologic, and head and neck neoplasms. The banking of prostate specimens was started in 1991 by Michael Becich, M.D., Ph.D.; and CPCTR, of which Dr. Becich and Rajiv Dhir, M.D., are Co- Principal Investigators, was funded three years ago. The banking, di- rected by Dr. Dhir, occurs at four main academic University of Pitts- burgh Medical Center (UPMC) hospitals in Pittsburgh, including Magee-Women’s Hospital of UPMC, UPMC Presbyterian, UPMC Shadyside, and Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC.
Dr. Becich is also Co-Principal Investigator of the Pennsylvania Cancer Alliance Bioinformatics Consortium, a group of six cancer research centers in Pennsylvania that has been funded to develop “a statewide serum and tissue repository, a data model for biomarker data storage, a statewide model for bioinformatics, a public access website for disseminating research results, and a strategic plan to sup- port aggressive collaboration between industry and academia” (http://pcabc.upmc.edu/).
Dr. Becich, Chairman of Pathology at UPMC Shadyside, Direc- tor of the Center for Pathology Informatics, and the Benedum On- cology Informatics Center; Dr. Dhir, Director of Genitourinary Pa- thology and of the University of Pittsburgh HSTB; John Gilbertson, M.D., Director of Bioinformatics; Ashok Patel, M.D.; and Michelle Bisceglia, Manager of the HSTB Laboratory, were interviewed during a site visit to UPMC Shadyside.
Ardais Corporation is a private clinical genomics company that grew out of a mutual interest among researchers at Duke University Medi- cal Center and Ardais founders to develop a tissue/data banking cen- ter that could simultaneously support the needs of Duke internal re- searchers and the broader research community. Ardais, in collaboration with its network of partner medical institutions, launched the National Clinical Genomics Initiative in September 2000, after obtaining initial funding in December 1999, to facilitate genomics-based biomedical research among academic and industrial researchers. The goals of the initiative are to develop systematic, large- scale procedures to comprehensively collect, process, and store re- search quality clinical materials and associated information; to pro- vide these resources in optimized formats for biomedical research; and to support the research and clinical programs at participating medical institutions. Ardais has established best practices working groups to provide advice, continually review, and ensure that opera- tions are ethically appropriate, technically excellent, and practical.
Alan Buckler, Ph.D., Senior Vice President of Research &amp; De- velopment, Chief Scientific Officer; Martin Ferguson, Ph.D., Senior Vice President of Bioinformatics; and numerous other individuals were interviewed on site as part of the NCI/NDC and RAND site visit to evaluate the tissue resources at Ardais.
GCI was established in 1998 primarily as a for-profit private biotech- nology research company designed to participate in and facilitate the application of genetic research to drug and diagnostic discovery deci- sions. Specimen collection began in earnest in March 2000 to collect multiple types of specimens (e.g., tissue, serum, and DNA) on the same patient, along with detailed medical and demographic informa- tion. GCI’s approach links human genes, proteins, and clinical out- comes through proprietary technology platforms. GCI offers human DNA, RNA, sera, and snap-frozen tissue specimens linked to detailed
medical information collected from patient populations worldwide. GCI personnel provide expertise in designing and conducting human genetic studies geared toward the development of therapeutics and diagnostics. They also offer high-throughput analysis tools, including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, DNA sequenc- ing, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and gene expression analyses.
GCI uses a dual business model. It has a fee-for-service side that works primarily with the pharmaceutical industry to design and col- lect specimens for drug development. The other side of the business participates in larger collaborative programs with pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, and academic and government insti- tutions.
Kevin Krenitsky, M.D., Senior Vice President, Medical Direc- tor; Kristin Ardlie, Ph.D., Vice President, Genetics; and Scott Mahan, Laboratory Director, were interviewed.
Several repositories originally selected for inclusion in this study were not evaluated. The reasons are as follows:
It was not possible to schedule interviews with the Johns Hopkins University Lymphoma SPORE and the Vanderbilt University Breast, Gastrointestinal, and Lung SPOREs. The Lymphoma SPORE at Johns Hopkins University was established in 2002, and the Principal Investigator indicated that the SPORE would be better able to discuss best practices in six months when the program was more established, putting an interview outside the time frame of this study. The Direc- tor of Tissue Profiling Informatics at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, was contacted about participating in the study; however, it was not possible to schedule an interview within the time frame of this study.
IMPATH Inc., a private company formed in 1988 to improve out- comes for cancer patients by providing cancer information and analy- ses, was identified because it has a database of over one million pa- tient profiles and outcomes data on over 2.3 million individuals and because it represents a for-profit repository model. The Vice Presi- dent and Scientific Director at IMPATH was initially eager to par- ticipate in the study; however, once the interview request was referred to the legal department, the process was held up over concerns about proprietary issues. The Scientific Director was not able to arrange for the necessary approvals from IMPATH legal and management in time to be included in the interview process.
maintenance organizations, and has distributed them to investigators. The Chief Executive Officer of NSABP indicated that there was an ongoing independent audit of NSABP and that as a result, tissue col- lection practices might be altered substantially in the near future. Therefore, she declined to participate in the study.
The Program for Critical Technologies in Molecular Medicine is a shared resource of the Yale Cancer Center within the Department of Pathology at Yale University School of Medicine. The program, es- tablished in 1992, is a collaborative core laboratory set up for state-of- the-art histologic, genetic, and molecular analysis of human tumors to complement clinical studies in prevention, diagnosis, and treat- ment of cancer. More than 10,000 frozen specimens have been col- lected for research purposes, and more than 3 million archived paraf- fin blocks from clinical cases are available.
The leaders of the repository recently changed. Although they were willing to be interviewed, they stated that they had recently experienced a variety of problems related to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), personnel changes, and tissue costs that have limited their effectiveness. Overall, they did not think their current operations would yield any “best practices.” Therefore, the Program for Critical Technologies in Molecular Medi- cine was not evaluated for this study.
Best practices were determined and agreed upon by the RAND re- search team based on the findings at the twelve repositories evaluated and the goal of the NBN Design Team to establish a national net- work of biospecimen repositories to collect, process, store, and dis- tribute appropriately consented diseased and normal tissue with asso- ciated clinical data supported and coordinated by an accessible, searchable, and minable bioinformatics system. Best practices were defined as strategies, systems, processes, and methodologies that should be used by a repository to provide a robust resource for ge- nomics- and proteomics-based research in the areas of biospecimen and data collection, storage, and distribution; bioinformatics and data management; meeting the needs of researchers; business plan and op- erations; ethical and legal issues; and public relations, marketing, and education.
The interviewees in all cases were forthcoming about almost all in- formation requested by RAND. There were, however, a few incidents where repositories declined to share specific information. For in- stance, both GCI and Ardais declined to provide cost information (costs of collecting, storing, and distribution, as well as prices they charge for tissue and tissue-related services). CHTN Eastern Division
did not share the names of its specimen-source satellite institutions, because it did not want to jeopardize the special relationships it had developed with these institutions.
Each biospecimen repository evaluated for this study was established to fulfill a specific set of objectives, and the design of each repository is integrally linked to those objectives. Techniques for tissue collec- tion, processing, annotation, and storage—the core functions of a biospecimen repository—vary depending on the purpose for which the repository was established. Likewise, the quality and extent of in- formation collected with the specimens vary depending on the pur- pose for which the tissue was originally collected. Details about bio- specimen collection, processing, annotation, storage, and distribution at each repository evaluated and the best practices identified are de- scribed in this chapter.
All twelve of the repositories collect tissue that was originally removed for routine medical care, such as surgery, or other diagnostic or medi- cal procedures. Five of the repositories (EDRN, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, NHLBI, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, and GCI) also collect specimens from people who volunteer to participate in clinical trials, registries, or other research projects. Table 3.1 pro- vides a profile of the tissue sources for the twelve repositories evalu- ated.

Some of the repositories actively recruit individuals to contrib- ute tissue to their repositories (Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI). Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE identifies potential sources of tissue after the surgery has occurred and the pathologists have reviewed the tissue. AFIP primarily receives specimens from pathologists at other institu- tions requesting a second opinion.
CHTN, TARP, AFIP, and University of Pittsburgh HSTB also collect tissue from autopsy. CHTN collects normal tissue (for com- parison with diseased tissue) from autopsy and from organ transplan- tation—both normal organs not suitable for transplant purposes and the diseased organs that were removed. Likewise, University of Pitts- burgh HSTB collects normal tissue from organ donors who consent to donate their organs for research. University of Pittsburgh HSTB also has a Warm Autopsy Program, in which it collects specimens of metastatic tumors from autopsies performed within hours of death on cancer patients (mainly prostate cancer patients living in hospice care) who have consented before dying.
EDRN, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, and NHLBI primarily collect specimens specifically for research purposes. However, the NHLBI LAM Registry and the Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry also collect surgical specimens of diseased tis- sue.
Biospecimen collection by CHTN is request driven. Therefore, CHTN collects specific types of tissue in response to the needs of re- searchers. CHTN obtains tissue primarily from surgical patients. It also collects some cytological and clinical laboratory (e.g., blood and serum) biospecimens. Some tissue is collected from organ transplanta- tions—both normal organs that could not be used for transplant pur- poses (particularly eyes)—and the diseased organs that were removed. Some tissue is also collected from autopsy. On occasion, there are private donors who voluntarily donate tissue, blood, and/or urine. In addition, some tissue is collected from individuals who are partici-
The tissue used to make the TARP microarrays that are distrib- uted to the research community comes mainly from CHTN. The tis- sue is primarily tumors from cancer patients and normal tissue from patients with diseases other than cancer. TARP also builds tissue mi- croarrays as part of collaborative research, and tissue comes from such diverse sources as the NIH Clinical Center, Poland, China, and U.S. and international cooperative groups. Specimens used to make the tissue microarrays for collaborative studies are supplied by the col- laborators.
EDRN, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, and NHLBI recruit volunteers for tissue donation as part of their partici- pation in clinical trials, as members of disease-specific registries, or for other types of research. The tissue sources for EDRN are volunteers who have agreed to be part of clinical trials or other research. Simi- larly, NHLBI LAM tissue sources are study volunteers or LAM pa- tients who have enrolled in the LAM Registry. In addition to the LAM Registry, the LAM Foundation helps to recruit tissue sources. Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry recruits families through several sources. A proband (a patient with breast or ovarian cancer) or someone with a very strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer (FCCC has a very large “high risk” program for cancer) is identified first, and then Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry tries to enroll additional family members. Philadelphia Familial Breast Can- cer Registry also networks with several community hospitals that refer participants. Tissue comes from breast and ovarian cancer patients, participants in the “high risk” program, volunteers, and family mem- bers.
Tissue collected by AFIP is primarily from surgical patients. However, AFIP does not recruit tissue sources. AFIP is a referral service to primary pathologists, and it is the pathologist who submits the specimen.
Duke University Breast SPORE primarily collects tissue from patients undergoing breast biopsies or surgery for breast cancer. Oc- casionally, normal breast tissue is collected for specific projects. Like- wise, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs collect tissue from pa- tients undergoing surgery for breast or ovarian cancer. Nurses in the breast and gynecology oncology clinics at UAB identify patients that are eligible for Breast SPORE and Ovarian SPORE protocols and obtain informed consent from those patients. Information about which patients consented to participate in the SPORE protocols is communicated with the SPOREs prior to surgery. Normal and dis- eased tissues are also collected for the UAB SPOREs for use as con- trols for the cancer specimens.
Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE collects tissue from patients un- dergoing either radical or supra-pubic prostatectomy. Tissue sources are identified after the tissue is received in the pathology laboratory, a frozen section analysis has been done, and the pathologist has verified that there is tissue available for research. A registered nurse working for the SPORE is notified that tissue was collected and then visits the patient in the hospital room within 24 hours after the surgery to ob- tain consent for use of the tissue for research purposes. At University of Pittsburgh HSTB, tissue is primarily from cancer patients. Normal prostate and bladder tissue is also collected from organ donors, and metastatic tumors are collected through the Warm Autopsy Program. The Warm Autopsy Program allows University of Pittsburgh HSTB to collect metastatic tumors that might otherwise not be available. It also has institutional review board (IRB) approval to access the medical records of the cancer patients to retrieve medical histories. About 5 percent of the tissue at University of Pittsburgh HSTB comes from clinical trial work. Individuals who are potential tissue sources are recruited in the clinical offices, usually by an oncologist and a research nurse coordinator.
Ardais and GCI collect tissue from surgical patients. Individuals who contribute tissue to Ardais are recruited by research nurses working (typically) within the pre-op admissions area, while GCI tis- sue sources are recruited by participating physicians or by full-time employees responsible for recruitment and tissue collection at GCI’s
collection sites. (GCI’s Web site also has information for those who are interested in volunteering to donate tissue.)
As Table 3.1 shows, all of the repositories collect specimens from mi- nority populations. Some repositories set out to include as much di- versity as possible. For example, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry has funding to specifically genotype minority families for BRCA1 and BRCA2.2 CHTN also tries to collect tissue from as broad a spectrum as possible from different racial and ethnic groups, but specimen collection is a function of the requests submitted by researchers. In addition, CHTN divisions reach out to community hospitals to increase the diversity of the specimens collected. Others collect specimens from minorities based on the diversity of the pa- tients/volunteers seen at that institution. For example, the specimens at Duke University Breast SPORE, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, and University of Pittsburgh HSTB reflect the distribution of minorities seen by those institutions (including any collaborating/contributing institutions). Still others, such as NHLBI LAM Registry and Ardais collect specimens based on defined clinical characteristics, not specific demographic characteris- tics. Collecting tissue from ethnically diverse populations of all ages in order to ensure diversity of the tissue available for research pur- poses, to be demographically representative of the population, and to expand biomedical research to include understudied/under- represented populations and to study health disparities is a best prac- tice.
2 Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer 1 and 2 genes) make some people more susceptible to developing breast and other types of cancer. Women who inherit a mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have an increased risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer at a young age (before menopause) and often have multiple close family members with the disease. These women may also have an increased chance of developing colon cancer. Men with a mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have an increased risk of breast cancer and prostate cancer. Alterations in the BRCA2 gene have also been associated with an increased risk of lymphoma, melanoma, and cancers of the pancreas, gallbladder, bile duct, and stomach.
CHTN, EDRN, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, and AFIP collect specimens from children. For example, CHTN Pediatric Divi- sion is dedicated to the procurement of pediatric specimens. In addi- tion, several of the CHTN divisions and University of Pittsburgh HSTB include collection sites at children’s hospitals. Ardais has IRB approval to collect specimens from minors using a parental consent process, but it has not started to do so. Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry would also like to start collecting specimens from children.
Several of the repositories also collect specimens from tissue sources in other countries. AFIP receives tissue specimens from all over the world, TARP has collaborations with investigators that col- lect specimens from Poland and China, and GCI has (or has had) collection sites in Belgium, Poland, Tunisia, Vietnam, and India. Several of the participating EDRN centers have ongoing collabora- tions with the United Kingdom, Canada, and Israel. Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry also collects specimens from family members residing outside the United States, and two of the other breast and ovarian CFRs are located outside the United States, in Canada and Australia.
For the most part, specimens are collected at academic medical cen- ters and community hospitals. CHTN Eastern Division also works with eye banks and organ procurement organizations to obtain eyes and organs for research use. Specimens sent to AFIP have been col- lected at hospitals (both academic and community) and private phy- sicians’ offices. Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry also gets blood, collected by family physicians, from participants’ family mem- bers. Blood for NHLBI is also collected at clinical laboratories, while tissue specimens from individuals with LAM are removed at medical facilities (community hospitals and academic medical centers). As mentioned earlier, specimens at Duke University Breast SPORE, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, and University of Pittsburgh HSTB come solely from their affiliated academic medical centers. Ardais collects from three aca-
demic medical centers and one hospital. GCI has an extensive net- work of 700 collection sites throughout the United States and in sev- eral foreign countries. Establishing a network of collection sites is a best practice in an effort to obtain a variety of specimen types and to be demographically representative of the population.
Most of the repositories/collection sites use some combination of pathologists, pathology assistants, histotechnologists, tissue techni- cians, and trained repository personnel for the collection of tissue. NHLBI, Duke University Breast SPORE, and Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry use phlebotomists and clinical personnel to collect blood samples. Researchers are typically not part of the speci- men collection process.
A typical scenario for tissue collection at most of the repositories is as follows: Pathology assistants or other trained repository person- nel monitor the operating room (OR) schedule to determine when a surgery is going to occur from which tissue will be collected. (Duke University Breast SPORE noted it was no longer able to identify tis- sue sources through the OR schedule due to HIPAA requirements.) The surgeon removes the tissue according to whatever surgical proce- dure is performed, and the tissue is sent to the pathology laboratory. A pathologist examines the tissue and takes what is necessary for pa- tient diagnosis and decides what portion of the specimen is excess and can be released to the repository. At several repositories, the patient’s diagnosis is rendered by the pathologist before the specimen is given to the repository in order to ensure that the specimen is not needed for further diagnostic workup. Allowing pathologists to determine what tissue is necessary for pathologic diagnosis and what is excess and available to give to the repository for storage and research use is a best practice. The portion of the specimen intended for the reposi- tory is immediately given to trained repository personnel (usually a pathology assistant or histotechnologist), who begin processing the specimen either for preservation and storage or for immediate ship- ment if requested fresh.
The number of people employed to collect, process, store, and distribute tissue varies among repositories. Each repository has its own organizational structure and procedures for collecting, process- ing, and storing tissue, which influence the number and types of per- sonnel utilized to carry out these processes. For example, CHTN, Ar- dais, and GCI have core personnel at their center of operations who are employees of the repository, and they have additional personnel at the collection sites who are trained by the repository but are employ- ees of the collection site institutions. CHTN also sends its own em- ployees to collection sites in their immediate geographic area. In con- trast, all of the personnel involved in repository functions at AFIP are employees of AFIP, but since AFIP is a referral center, it does not have personnel at the collection sites.
The following list gives several examples of the numbers and types of personnel involved in repository functions:
CHTN Eastern Division has 12 to 13 FTEs (full-time equiva- lents), including the people assigned to distribute TARP mi- croarrays and to carry out national marketing, but not counting personnel at the satellite sites. CHTN Eastern Division has seven to eight primary staff members and several others with less than full-time commitments (e.g., some pathologists may only dedicate approximately 10 percent of their time to CHTN work). Other staff are distributed among the remote sites, but the amount of their time spent doing CHTN work is approxi- mately equal to two FTEs. At satellite sites, specimens are col- lected either by CHTN Eastern Division staff from the Univer- sity of Pennsylvania who go to the site or by CHTN-funded and
-trained staff who work at the site. The number of people working at remote sites depends on the needs of researchers re- questing tissues from CHTN.
The collection, storage, processing, and distribution of speci- mens for EDRN are done at the individual network participant locations, primarily academic medical centers, using standard- ized protocols.
AFIP is not involved in the collection of specimens. It employs 75 people to receive, store, maintain, and retrieve the tissue specimens. In addition, ten volunteer high school students work with the repository staff.
Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE has six individuals who are trained to collect and process tissue (two at each of the two community hospitals affiliated with the Mayo Clinic and two at the Mayo Clinic, where tissue is stored), and a team of individuals (a regis- tered nurse, a pathologist, and two scientists) that oversees the disbursement of tissue.
University of Pittsburgh HSTB has one medical director, one laboratory manager, seven tissue bankers, three cancer registrars, two laboratory technicians, two cancer biomarker technicians, and one medical fellow (who assists with data management) working in the tissue bank and affiliated laboratories. There is also a director of Oncology and Pathology Informatics and a di- rector of Research Informatics, as well as a team of bioinformati- cians.
Ardais has six to eight FTEs at each of four collection sites who are employees of the hospitals, but whose salaries, benefits, and overhead are reimbursed by Ardais via a grant mechanism. The typical contingent includes research nurses (informed consent process), multiple part-time pathologists (initial banking deci- sion and management), a pathology assistant (specimen banking SOPs), a histotechnologist/tissue technician, a repository clerk (local repository management/shipping), and clinical data man- agers. Additionally, the protocol principal investigators (the chair or vice-chair of Pathology) have management responsibili- ties but are not compensated. Ardais currently has approxi- mately 60 employees and consultants at their headquarters in Lexington, MA.
GCI has 27 employees at its headquarters in Cambridge, MA. There is also one FTE at each collection site. The GCI people at the collection sites (e.g., community hospitals) are paid by the collection sites, an arrangement the site agrees to when it signs up to be a GCI collection location. Although the site people are
not GCI employees, this arrangement ensures that there is one person at each collection site dedicated to the consent, collec- tion, and shipping of specimens to GCI.
There are three main models of collection and storage operations: de- centralized collection with centralized storage, centralized collection and storage, and decentralized collection and storage (Figure 6.1, in Chapter Six, provides a diagram of different centralized and decen- tralized models). Many of the repositories are decentralized in the collection of specimens—meaning there are multiple collection sites that are geographically dispersed, usually involving some combination of academic medical centers and community hospitals—but store their specimens in a centralized facility (TARP, NHLBI, AFIP, Ar- dais, and GCI). Some repositories have both centralized collection and storage, such as Duke University Breast SPORE, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, and Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, whose specimens come solely from their affiliated academic medical centers.
In contrast, both collection and storage of specimens are decen- tralized for CHTN, EDRN, the Breast and Ovarian CFRs (of which the Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry is a member), and University of Pittsburgh HSTB. Specimens collected by the six CHTN regional divisions and their collaborating community hospital sites are usually transferred to the main regional division sites and dis- tributed from there, while fresh (meaning not frozen) specimens usu- ally go directly from collection sites to the researchers. The specimens collected for EDRN and the CFRs are stored at collection/storage sites that are geographically dispersed. University of Pittsburgh HSTB collects and stores specimens at four academic medical centers that are part of the UPMC hospital system.
When specimens are sent to a centralized storage facility, most are transferred via overnight service (e.g., Federal Express® [FedEx®]) or by local couriers. EDRN, the SPOREs at Duke University and UAB, and University of Pittsburgh HSTB store specimens locally. Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE collects tissue from two affiliated hos- pitals that are connected to its processing facility.
Repositories that collect tissue from multiple sites each have their own procedures for shipping specimens to a centralized storage facility—by international shipping companies (e.g., FedEx®) or local couriers, at room temperature, on dry ice, or in liquid nitrogen. All of the repositories follow International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations for transporting hazardous substances, when ap- plicable. For example:
At CHTN Eastern Division, specimens procured locally are transported on wet or dry ice by the procuring technician or lo- cal courier service. Specimens from non-local collection sites are sent via FedEx® on dry ice. Fresh tissue from all collection sites goes directly to the researcher. Shipments are scheduled, ex- pected, and monitored by CHTN Eastern Division. Tracking of shipments and expected receipts is integrated with the bioinfor- matics system. Shipping containers and procedures are stan- dardized, training is provided, and CHTN Eastern Division monitors adherence to the standards. All applicable regulations are met or exceeded. Changes in regulations are monitored by the CHTN Regulatory Affairs Subcommittee, participation in the International Society for Biological and Environmental Re- positories (ISBER), and guidance from local institutional safety officers.
Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry supplies FedEx® kits to remote collection sites for overnight shipment of samples via FedEx®.
NHLBI ships specimens via courier (FedEx® or private courier) in containers with dry ice. Containers are tested in house both for individual unit function (i.e., temperature probing and mock shipment) and for design quality (e.g., test to failure to deter- mine container limitations). BBI validates that all shippers are using proper configuration and containers. The clinical sites fill out a form to accompany the specimen and send a copy of the form to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC). If something is wrong with the specimen, then it is tracked in the tracking folder. If shippers continually ship incorrectly, BBI cites the
Ardais ships all of its specimens from the medical centers to Ar- dais headquarters via FedEx®. Standardized and carefully moni- tored shipping procedures are integrated with Ardais’s informa- tion technology system, which tracks all shipments and expected receipts. The specimens are packed in dry ice in self-contained, pressurized containers within an IATA-approved external con- tainer.
GCI provides collection personnel with vapor-shippers for tissue specimens and collection kits for blood and serum specimens. All collection kits are tagged with a bar code label that denotes the specimen collection site. The same bar code is attached to the collection tubes. GCI tissue specimens are shipped in liquid nitrogen vapor-shippers and sent via FedEx®. DNA, plasma, and serum are packed on ice and shipped overnight as they are col- lected. Blood is also shipped out as it is collected. The bar codes on all the specimens are scanned once they arrive at GCI.
Using standardized and carefully monitored shipping procedures with systems to track all shipments and expected receipts is a best practice.
Most of the repositories verify the integrity of every tissue after collec- tion: CHTN, TARP, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, Duke University Breast SPORE, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI. Quality assurance (QA) procedures at these reposi- tories include matching the tissue received with the pathology report and other documents provided with it and review by a pathologist of an H&amp;E (hematoxylin and eosin) stained slide made from each specimen. This is a best practice. In contrast, some repositories de- pend on the sites that collect the original specimen. For example, AFIP acquires tissue specimens that have been collected and proc-
essed at the institutions that originally obtained the tissue from pa- tients. EDRN requires that QA measures be built into protocols and that the protocols undergo extensive peer review before it approves them.
Some repositories may also perform additional, quality control (QC) testing. For example, material used in the construction of tissue microarrays by TARP may be subjected to additional QC, including RNA integrity by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining to match known profiles. GCI also checks RNA integrity and performs genetic marker tests on blood to verify and characterize the specimens.
Ardais and GCI also utilize a standardized collection protocol, collection kits, and a bar-coding system to track specimens. For ex- ample, GCI provides the collection personnel with collection kits for blood and serum samples and vapor-shippers for tissue specimens. All collection kits are tagged with a bar-code label and that same bar code is attached to the collection tubes. Additional bar-code labels are pro- vided in the kit; these are attached to all paperwork associated with that specimen. The specimens are tracked during collection and stor- age using this bar code. BBI and University of Pittsburgh HSTB also use a bar-code tracking system. Using an electronic tracking system to track specimens and associated information is a best practice. Cur- rently, bar codes are used for this purpose, but additional electronic technologies, including smart cards and radio-frequency identifica- tion tags, are available.
Many of the repositories have developed SOPs for collection of their specimens: CHTN, TARP, EDRN, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI. This is a best practice. In addition, CHTN, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI train collection personnel and provide standard pro- tocols for them to follow. This, too, is a best practice. CHTN uses a combination of CHTN staff and CHTN-trained personnel who are employees at the collection sites. University of Pittsburgh HSTB uses trained pathology assistants at its collection sites. Ardais and GCI train personnel who are employees at the collection sites.
CHTN, TARP, and Coriell Cell Repositories (CCR), which stores and distributes specimens for Philadelphia Familial Breast Can- cer Registry, also monitor the quality of the tissue they distribute through feedback from researchers receiving the tissue. A question- naire sent to researchers with each shipment asks for feedback on the quality of the tissue that was received. For example, the questionnaire sent by CHTN to researchers with each shipment asks for feedback on everything from the quality of the tissue and the accompanying data that were sent, to the packaging and the timely receipt of the sample. CHTN also sends a more extensive annual questionnaire to researchers that solicits input on past quality, current usage, and fu- ture needs. Many of the other repositories also request feedback from researchers, but the process is less formal.
QA processes ensure the integrity of both the clinical and the technical aspects of the operation. QA at participating institutions that provide tissue is assured, for the most part, by pathologists at the repository, who check the quality and verify the diagnosis of the tis- sue that was sent. In addition, Ardais and GCI scan the bar codes on specimens and check them against the shipping manifest and other paperwork. EDRN’s participating centers or laboratories are subject to biennial site visits by NCI personnel and outside advisors, or to more frequent visits if NCI deems they are necessary.
CHTN Eastern Division has daily interactions and is in con- stant communication with its collection sites through phone calls and e-mail. This level of communication is integral to CHTN Eastern Division’s ability to fill researcher requests and identify needs or problems at collection sites. University of Pittsburgh HSTB and Ar- dais also ensure standards at contributing institutions through weekly contact with medical center site personnel and monthly operations meetings/phone conferences. Ensuring standards at institutions that contribute specimens to the repository through close contact with collection site personnel is a best practice.
Some of the repositories require that certain standards be met by institutions that provide tissue. For example, EDRN participants are required to adhere to principles laid out by EDRN. Each proposal to EDRN undergoes extensive peer review before being approved. To
remain in the network, EDRN participants must reapply for funding every five years, at which time they must verify that they are follow- ing EDRN standards and protocols. In contrast, TARP, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, NHLBI LAM Registry, and AFIP accept some specimens “as is” from submitting institutions and evaluate the quality of a specimen after it arrives at the repository.
GCI has taken action against several DNA and tissue collection sites that lacked appropriate QA standards. TARP will also drop col- laborators that chronically submit poor-quality specimens. Ardais communicates lapses in standardization or quality back to collection sites and addresses them during co-management activities. Major lapses could result in termination of a banking agreement between Ardais and an institution as a collection site, but such action has not taken place to date.
Careful and well-documented processing and extensive annotation of tissue specimens are crucial to the overall usefulness of the repository as a resource for scientific research. Although it is important and nec- essary to remain flexible in meeting researcher needs in order to keep pace with new approaches in biospecimen research, a certain level of standardization will always be needed for such research to be applica- ble and useful in the long term. Some of the repositories evaluated for this study stress the standardization of all their specimens, while oth- ers focus on remaining flexible to be able to respond to as many dif- ferent researcher requests as possible. Details about biospecimen processing and annotation at the repositories evaluated are provided in the following subsections.
Biospecimen processing procedures can involve the physical treat- ment of the specimens both at the time of their collection and after their receipt at the repositories. Techniques for processing the actual
specimens at collection sites at the time of collection varied across the repositories evaluated. At CHTN, where specimens are collected and treated according to researcher requests, these procedures are not strictly standardized. The processing of specimens at CHTN varies according to the protocol of each individual investigator: (a) fresh tis- sue can be collected aseptically and sent to researchers in transfer me- dia of their choice, (b) specimens can be snap frozen, or (c) specimens can be fixed or paraffin embedded. While CHTN is able to provide researchers with customized procurement, the basic techniques used to process the specimens are standardized (e.g., snap freezing is done the same way each time, paraffin embedding is done the same way, and time of formalin fixation is the same) unless the researcher spe- cifically requests that the processing be done differently. For instance, CHTN Eastern Division reported that approximately 80 percent of the specimens collected are procured and processed for storage within one hour post-excision, as processing specimens as quickly as possible makes them useful for the broadest possible range of researchers.
The UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs try to collect and process some specimens from each case within 15 to 30 minutes of availabil- ity in the OR. Additional tissue from the case is often collected in Surgical Pathology. All UAB SPORE specimens are frozen and stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen. All Duke University Breast SPORE specimens are frozen within one hour of extraction and stored in mechanical freezers at –135°C with liquid nitrogen backup. At Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, the tissue specimens are sent to a hospital accessioning area after collection, at which point the reposi- tory technicians are notified. The specimens are then treated with OCT (optimum cutting temperature) embedding compound, snap frozen, and placed in –70°C freezers. At University of Pittsburgh HSTB, tissue bankers are in constant contact with the OR to mini- mize the time from when the tissue is excised until it is frozen. Most specimens are collected within one hour of excision and are snap fro- zen in an isopentane bath unless a researcher requests a different pro- cedure.
BBI, EDRN, and AFIP do not deal directly with collection and initial processing of specimens. EDRN does regulate the processing
procedures of its network collection sites in order to standardize the specimens; and, similarly, specimens being stored at BBI are collected according to clients’ protocols (in this case, the NHLBI LAM study). AFIP does not require standard collection procedures for the speci- mens it receives.
Ardais has detailed, standardized protocols for specimen prepa- ration. These protocols are followed uniformly at all collecting sites. All equipment is provided by Ardais and is standard at all locations. Over 70 percent of specimens are collected within one hour. A pathologist immediately reviews each specimen to determine which portion of it is available for use by Ardais. Specimen preparation is customized to the type of tissue being processed. Typically, specimens are cut to provide a reference sample (destined for formalin fixation and paraffin embedding) flanked by one or more samples (destined for freezing). Frozen material is embedded in OCT. The orientation of the specimens is specified such that cutting surfaces reflect adja- cency. Samples are part of a “module” with defined structure so that the physical adjacency of every sample from a specimen is maintained in the database. Each sample container is bar coded and logged into the system. Fixation times are controlled and logged into the database for each sample.
GCI also provides collection site personnel with standardized protocols to follow for preparation of specimens for the repository and collection of medical information from donors. The majority of specimens at GCI were procured in less than one hour. The process- ing of specimens after arrival at GCI varies depending on the sample type (e.g., RNA extraction from tissue, transformation of cell lines from lymphocytes). Procurement and processing of specimens for storage within one hour post-excision using detailed, standardized protocols is a best practice.
At Ardais, BBI, and GCI, where regular shipments of specimens are received from collection sites, somewhat similar procedures are followed. Shipping manifests are checked against both a list of ex- pected specimens and the actual contents of the shipment. At Ardais and GCI, this is just a matter of matching the codes on the vials to
those on the lists; at BBI, a data collection sheet is filled out for every shipment.
Several of the repositories perform histopathology (H&amp;E staining) on all tissue specimens, which is reviewed by a pathologist. For example, a CHTN pathologist reviews a QC H&amp;E slide from every specimen collected by CHTN. The pathologist verifies tissue morphology as well as other tissue characteristics, such as percentage of tumor, ne- crosis, fibrosis, and mucin. In addition to assuring researchers that the tissue they are receiving is really what it is labeled, this approach pro- vides a valuable tool for oversight of the quality of samples from con- tributing institutions. This is an important adjunct to the oversight provided by the local pathologists at the satellite collection sites, who are charged with overseeing procurement (under CHTN direction) at their own institutions. At TARP, not only is an initial H&amp;E slide evaluated from each paraffin block of tissue chosen for inclusion in an array, but also, once the array is constructed, every 50th slide cut from the tissue microarray is H&amp;E stained and evaluated.
Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE verifies all tissue by microscopic examination of H&amp;E stained slides. H&amp;Es and other stains are scanned, and the digital images are placed on a server for other re- searchers using the tissue. This conserves tissue and prevents deple- tion of tissue that might otherwise be used for repeat H&amp;E slide preparation. At UAB, a paraffin block is made that corresponds to each specimen, and a slide is H&amp;E stained and reviewed by a pathologist. Researchers are provided with information about the specimen found when reviewing the H&amp;E slide. University of Pitts- burgh HSTB has a digital whole-slide imaging system that allows pathologists to evaluate samples over the Internet. Ardais uses in- house and consultant pathologists to confirm the pathology reports received with the specimens and verify each specimen. Digital images of specimens are available through a Web-accessible interface prior to distribution to researchers, or to generating tissue arrays or molecular derivatives. GCI has hired two pathologists from nearby Massachu-
setts General Hospital to review and annotate records based on review of the H&amp;E stained slides. Verification and evaluation by a patholo- gist of tissue specimens collected by the repository is a best practice.
A few of the repositories routinely perform other standard labo- ratory tests on the specimens upon their arrival. These often involve more extensive clinical characterizations of the specimens. In addition to its H&amp;E slide review procedures (discussed above), TARP per- forms immunohistochemical tests and in situ hybridization on speci- mens for QC purposes. GCI performs genetic marker tests on all blood/sera received and follows extensive procedures to standardize the volume and concentration of these specimens. (Specimen identity and characterization are checked and monitored throughout these procedures.) GCI also routinely performs RNA extractions on a sub- set of its tissue specimens. University of Pittsburgh HSTB also per- forms RNA integrity checks on a subset of its specimens. When re- positories perform these types of tests, any results or further annotation collected are usually provided along with the pathology report that is given to the researcher. At most repositories, however, special tests or preparations (such as DNA, RNA, protein prepara- tions, tissue microarrays, immunohistochemistry, and laser capture microdissection) are done only at researcher request.
Results and annotations gathered from H&amp;E stained slides or any other assays or tests performed on the specimens upon arrival and throughout their lives at the repository are linked to the specimens and provided to researchers, a practice followed to some extent by all repositories evaluated for this study. This procedure is a best prac- tice. Providing information about the specimen obtained during the QC histopathologic examination and tissue characterization (includ- ing digital images of stained slides, when appropriate) in a database for other researchers to access is also a best practice.
Most repositories collect basic pathology data about each specimen, which usually includes demographic and diagnostic information. Some also try to collect medical history and clinical outcomes data
(Table 3.2). For example, the type of data available with most speci- mens collected by CHTN, NHLBI, AFIP, Duke University SPORE, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI includes the pa- thology or autopsy report (“scrubbed” to remove all patient identifi- ers) and basic demographics (age, race, and sex). Ardais provides an abstracted version of the pathology report to its customers using stan- dardized nomenclature. Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE collects limited patient information with its specimens.
EDRN requires network collection sites to collect certain com- mon data elements (CDEs) with each specimen (a technique also used by the Breast and Ovarian Cancer Family Registries and Ardais). Decisions about what to include as CDEs are made collaboratively by EDRN members; after a new CDE is proposed, there is a brief period during which members may comment on the usefulness or necessity of the new CDE and voice their opinions on whether or how it should be included. Weekly committee discussions are held to ad- dress questions that arise regarding the CDEs. A core set of CDEs is collected by EDRN members for every specimen; it includes demo- graphic information, tobacco and smoking history, cancer history, family cancer history, and menstrual history. Additional CDEs are collected that are tailored to the type of specimen being collected (e.g., tissue or blood specimens) and the organ site (e.g., breast, pros- tate, or colon). Sometimes diagnostic information or information about the patient’s medical history is also available. Specimens col- lected by researchers prior to joining EDRN are often added to the EDRN database. The data accompanying these specimens is trans- lated into the EDRN CDEs using a tool that was developed specifi- cally for this purpose. Once the data on each specimen are collected, they are added to the on-line database that links all of the collection sites participating in EDRN. TARP is also implementing the Tissue Microarray Data Exchange Specification, which is a tool for organiz- ing tissue microarray data in self-describing XML documents using a set of CDEs (Berman, Edgerton, and Friedman, 2003). Ardais has a defined minimal data set for each specimen accrued. When relevant to the diagnosis, those data elements are common across specimens.
aData are for the NHLBI LAM Registry. No data about the specimen are available at the repository itself. The LAM Reg- istry collects clinical, longitudinal, pathology report, diagnostic, demographic (gender, ethnicity), medical history, fam- ily history, medical and surgical treatment, and quality of life data. Survival is an outcomes variable.
Many repositories collect additional information with their specimens beyond that included in the pathology report: CHTN, NHLBI, EDRN, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI (Table 3.2). For example, at GCI a 10- to 15-page case report, collected with every specimen, in- cludes demographic data, information about the patient’s lifestyle, diet, and family history, and some disease-specific information (such as medications, diagnostic methods, and any adverse reactions to medications). For the disease-specific information, GCI follows the nationally accepted “Gold Standard” criteria.3 Data deemed necessary by the current literature and governing organizations to ensure proper diagnosis are also required and collected by GCI (e.g., specimens col- lected representing coronary artery disease must include a copy of the angiogram confirming this diagnosis). Survival data are not available for tissue specimens because the links back to the patients are de- stroyed, but links are maintained to most DNA and serum speci- mens. For some samples, CHTN also collects information about treatment with chemotherapy or radiation, and about estrogen recep- tor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status for breast cancer samples. EDRN collects, through its CDEs, some medical/family history in- formation, which is available in its searchable databases.
The Breast and Ovarian Cancer Family Registries (and Phila- delphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry) was designed to support re- search on genetic epidemiology, clinical epidemiology, and social and behavioral epidemiology. Therefore, the data it collects are quite dif- ferent from those collected by most of the other repositories. For ex- ample, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry collects demo- graphic information, as well as data on family history (covering three generations), medical history, epidemiological history (heavily weighted to reproductive history because the registry deals with breast and ovarian cancers), cancer screening history (e.g., mammograms), smoking/exercise/dietary history, medication use, exposure to radia- tion and/or chemotherapy, and psychosocial measures. Philadelphia
Familial Breast Cancer Registry also conducts an annual follow-up to get information about changes in health status and cancer screening status.
University of Pittsburgh HSTB has well-annotated patient data, including demographics, medical history, lifestyle information, medi- cation use, and treatment history. University of Pittsburgh HSTB’s Organ Specific Database has disease-specific information, including tumor grades, that is generated through its interface with the Cancer Registry.
Best practices for data collection depend on the mission of the repository. Collections of biospecimens used primarily for basic re- search may only require minimal associated clinical data, such as demographic data and pathology reports, whereas collections used for translational research (e.g., target identification or validation) may require more in-depth associated clinical data, such as medical and family histories, treatment data, and clinical outcomes data. No mat- ter what the requirements for the amount of associated data are, certain best practices are applicable. Collecting consistent and high- quality data associated with biospecimens and employing a standard- ized set of CDEs that are collected with every biospecimen are best practices. In addition to basic demographic and pathologic data, some repositories also collect extensive data on family history, medi- cal history, lifestyle and diet, treatment, and clinical outcomes. Col- lection of complete data on all elements in a minimal data set de- signed to fulfill the mission of the repository and meet the needs of its users is a best practice.
All of the repositories evaluated for this study collect longitudinal data, but they do so to different extents (Table 3.2). The ability to effectively collect and store longitudinal data is a best practice. CHTN collects longitudinal data for limited cases when requested to do so by researchers and the data are available. Longitudinal data are not collected for the TARP microarrays distributed through CHTN, but such data are part of some of TARP’s collaborative studies, in which case they are collected by the collaborating researchers. Each
Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry collects longitudi- nal data through an annual questionnaire that is sent to partici- pants. If a patient has had a new diagnosis of breast or ovarian cancer, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry also tries to obtain a sample of the tumor.
The UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs track longitudinal data through a tumor registry. At Duke University Breast SPORE, a laboratory technician tracks longitudinal data through on-line medical records and a tumor registry. BBI tracks longitudinal data through a unique identification number given to each specimen. When AFIP gets new tissue from the same patient, it is tracked longitudinally by its unique AFIP identification num- ber, and AFIP may follow up clinically with how a patient is doing.
At Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, the Bioinformatics Depart- ment has access to the clinical information through the clinical databases. Information about everyone who comes to the Mayo Clinic for a radical prostatectomy is automatically entered into the database, and pre-operative, operative, and follow-up data are collected. If a patient does not come to Mayo for follow-up visits, he or she is automatically sent a follow-up questionnaire a year later. If the questionnaire is not returned, a letter seeking the information is sent to the referring doctor.
University of Pittsburgh HSTB tracks longitudinal data through the cancer registry, which automatically updates the repository data system. A case number is assigned for each patient/disease combination (i.e., a patient keeps the same case number if he/she comes back for follow-up visits, but if the patient comes back for a different disease, he or she gets a different case num- ber). Each organ system has a cancer registrar in charge of the database. The cancer registrar performs the clinical annotations using North American Association of Central Cancer Registries
Ardais recently started collecting longitudinal data upon request. These data are linked to the specimen via the case identification number. Only the dedicated personnel for data collection at the clinical sites can access the link to patient identifiers. Collection and de-identification of longitudinal data occur solely through those individuals working with Ardais-supplied case report forms.
GCI collects longitudinal data on approximately 85 percent of blood, serum, and DNA that it collects. It does not obtain lon- gitudinal data on tissue specimens, because these specimens have been unlinked (i.e., the links back to the patients are destroyed), so it is not possible to go back for additional information about the tissue sources. A link is maintained for most DNA and serum specimens, however. GCI uses a third party to keep the forms linking patients to their specimens.
At several repositories, each specimen is subject to a pathology verifi- cation process. CHTN Eastern Division utilizes several layers of QA, auditing, and standardization for its processing of biospecimens, in- cluding QC checks for histology and pathology that are performed by a CHTN pathologist, and a feedback questionnaire that is included with each shipment to ask about the quality of the samples received. As noted above, TARP stains every 50th slide cut from a tissue mi- croarray block with H&amp;E to check the integrity of the array, and may perform additional immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization studies to check for quality. Duke University Breast SPORE verifies all tissue before use in research assays by H&amp;E analysis. Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE examines a frozen section from every tissue collected by H&amp;E staining; it also does this after sections of the tissue have been cut from the specimen to ensure that there is still relevant tissue available for use. At Ardais, this pathology verification process adds a significant number of quantitative and qualitative data fields. Like-
wise, a slide of every tissue specimen is examined by a pathologist upon arrival at GCI. The pathologist confirms the identity and diag- nosis of the specimen and makes further annotations about its charac- teristics, including any special/unusual attributes. QC checks for his- tology and pathology by repository pathologists is a best practice.
Laboratory procedures followed by several of the repositories to stan- dardize and verify the actual specimens as they are received was dis- cussed above. Separate procedures are needed to manage and verify the information collected through these various standardization, processing, and annotation processes. For instance, each repository has developed its own way of checking and absorbing into its data- base information from pathology reports and other medical docu- mentation received with the specimen.
University of Pittsburgh HSTB has developed an integration system that automatically accesses the surgical pathology report, the cancer registry, and the repository database and extracts data into the repository database. For prostate tissue, the integration system also performs an automated de-identification procedure that has been ex- tensively tested to ensure that it can de-identify patient records while entering data into the tissue bank database. University of Pittsburgh HSTB routinely runs queries against the system to find data that are inconsistent, and continually checks the metadata dictionary to up- date the way data are converted.
As mentioned, Ardais sends abstracted pathology reports with the samples it sends to researchers. This is the result of a series of pro- cedures developed by Ardais to minimize manual data entry at all stages of the tissue banking process. In addition to bar coding all of its sample vials and storage boxes, Ardais hires physicians to continu- ally create and apply a standard terminology to all of its data collec- tion procedures. Raw pathology reports are abstracted using con- trolled vocabularies into structured data fields with quantitative and comparable values. Additionally, each sample is subject to a pathol- ogy verification process, which adds a significant number of quantita-
tive and qualitative data fields. Structured data are required to sup- port both database queries and the computational analysis of experi- mental results. Structured data also allow the creation of Web- deployed data-entry forms complete with drop-down menus and other features that minimize the errors associated with typing infor- mation into forms. CHTN also uses standardized histopathology terminology and drop-down menus to standardize the data in the database.
In a different approach, GCI uses a split screen (scanned-in original document on one side, blank GCI-specific form on the other) to help avoid data-entry errors. The data are entered into the GCI form manually. The scanned version of the original is there should anyone have any questions in the future. Ensuring the accu- racy of data entry through the use of standardized terminology and computer data-entry forms (e.g., drop-down menus) whenever possi- ble is a best practice.
Another strategy to minimize data-entry error is to include sev- eral additional checks in the process. CHTN Eastern Division re- ported using several checkpoints to make sure that the proper data are attached to the proper specimen. Specimen labeling is checked upon receipt of the specimen into the laboratory to confirm that all label information is correct and that no patient identifiers exist. After data entry, the information is verified by a second party to confirm that data entry is correct. CHTN Eastern Division has also developed a parsing technique, which involves using a computer program to re- view the text of the pathology report and confirm these data against the data that were entered into the database. The program notifies the user if there is a discrepancy and keeps records of when error tracking and reconciliation are done. Similarly, the GCI bioinformatics system automatically checks for consistency and omissions in the data ac- companying the specimens.
Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry also has edit checks built into its system to look for consistency and data that are out of boundaries. The UCI Informatics Center does more edit checks when the data are sent to the CFRs central bioinformatics system and pro- vides discrepancy reports for each CFRs site on data submission (i.e.,
Most repositories conduct at least one independent check of the data once they are entered into a database. Procedures at AFIP call for at least three checks of information sent with specimens to the reposi- tories, one of which is performed by a pathologist. All data at TARP and BBI are double key punched (i.e., data are entered twice), cross- reviewed, and checked.
In the decentralized repositories, such as EDRN, these checks are performed at a higher level. Specifically, EDRN’s Data Manage- ment and Coordinating Center requires (a) accuracy checks on the data mapping from the collecting institutions to the CDEs (these re- views are performed by two people); (b) validation checks comparing query results of the EDRN database to expected values from the insti- tution’s database; and (c) integrity checks that involve standard and random queries used to evaluate results and look for anomalies in the EDRN database. Ardais also reviews data for consistency during its pathology verification process. Implementing one or more independ- ent checks of the data once they are entered into the repository data- base is a best practice.
One additional aspect of QA at repositories is the tracking of specimens in the repository (i.e., anonymization, location, volume, and distribution status). The repositories evaluated revealed similar strategies for addressing these issues. Most repositories reported al- ready using or having definite plans to implement a system to track specimens through scannable bar codes. Such codes are used to track all information about a specimen over its lifetime at the repository. Several repositories mentioned specifically soliciting feedback from researchers regarding the quality and usability of the samples received. At CHTN, if the quality issue is tissue specific, this feedback is re- associated with the portion of the specimen still remaining in the re- pository. AFIP, which uses a unique seven-digit code for identifying each of its specimens, reported also having standard procedures for dealing with specimens received from patients who already have specimens stored in the repository. When this happens, the specimens are given the same accession number but a new sequence number.
University of Pittsburgh HSTB is also able to track patients through its database. If a patient returns to the health system at UPMC and has additional tissue procured, the database is able to make the identi- fication and link the new information to the previous record.
The number of tissue specimens stored at the repositories evaluated ranged from 1,100 prostate cancer specimens at Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE to over 90 million specimens representing the entire spec- trum of human disease at AFIP (Table 3.3). The types of stored tissue at all repositories include tissue from several types of cancer, tissue from other diseases, non-diseased matching adjacent tissue (i.e., mi- croscopically uninvolved by disease), blood, serum, plasma, urine, and normal tissue from autopsy, organ donation, or tissues from pa- tients undergoing surgery for an unrelated condition.
More specifically, the Pediatric Division of CHTN stores ap- proximately 85,000 specimens, including cancer, adjacent normal, and benign disease tissue. CHTN’s mandate is to distribute speci- mens, not to store them, although there are always some specimens that are in process and/or banked. TARP usually stores between 500 and 2,000 paraffin blocks of tissue in-house. These paraffin blocks of tissue are received, cores of tissue are removed and used to make the tissue microarray blocks, and then the tissue blocks are returned to their place of origin. Each tissue microarray block contains approxi- mately 300 to 500 cases. TARP usually has between 25 and 50 active array blocks to be cut and approximately 2,000 to 3,000 slides of ar- rays in storage. TARP collects primarily tumors, with approximately one-quarter having matched normal tissue. EDRN’s repositories con- tain over 382,000 specimens, with a focus on cancer tissues. These tissues have a number of normal and matched disease-specific con- trols. AFIP houses 2.8 million cases comprising more than 12 million wet tissue specimens, 30 million paraffin-embedded specimens, and

a Coriell Cell Repositories serves as the storage facility for specimens from three of the six Breast and Ovarian Cancer Family Registries. In addition to the specimens CCR stores and distributes for the Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, it stores 4,777 specimens and has distributed 3,415 samples for the Northern California Cooperative Family Registry, and stores 544 specimens and has distributed 355 samples for the Utah Coopera- tive Breast Cancer Registry.
50 million glass slides, about half of which are from cancer patients. Some frozen tissue is stored as part of ongoing research. BBI currently stores more than 3 million specimens, including blood and tissue from a variety of NHLBI-sponsored studies.
All of the repositories, except the part of BBI associated with NHLBI, store cancerous tissue. The SPOREs collect specimens of cancers specifically geared toward their area of study (i.e., Duke Uni- versity Breast SPORE only collects specimens of breast cancer, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE only collects specimens of prostate cancers). CHTN, GCI, and Ardais store specimens from numerous types of cancer, including head and neck malignancies, and carcinomas of the lung, gastrointestinal tract, breast, genitourinary system, prostate, kidney, and skin. Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry col- lects blood from breast and ovarian cancer patients, individuals at high risk for developing breast or ovarian cancer, and family mem- bers, and requests specimens of breast and ovarian cancer from pa- tients. University of Pittsburgh HSTB stores biospecimens that are primarily from cancer patients, including specimens from head and neck, lung, liver, breast, gastrointestinal, prostate, bladder, and gyne- cological tumors, as well as melanomas, sarcomas, blood products, and urine. It also collects normal tissue through organ donation and metastatic tumors through its Warm Autopsy Program. Specimens stored at Ardais are approximately 60 percent cancer and 40 percent other conditions, such as gastrointestinal inflammatory disease and bone/joint disease. Typically, about 60 percent of the neoplas- tic/lesional tissue specimens are associated with non-diseased match- ing adjacent tissue. GCI currently stores 60,000 to 80,000 specimens. Tissue from virtually every organ system in the body is collected, as well as DNA and sera from patients with several conditions, includ- ing cancer, asthma, diabetes (Type I and II), osteoarthritis, obesity, and others. CHTN and TARP also store tissues from other diseases, including vascular, diabetes, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases.
In addition to specimens of diseased tissue, all of the reposito- ries, except AFIP, NHLBI, and Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, collect non-diseased matching adjacent tissue and normal tissue controls from patients undergoing surgery for a different condi-
tion, organ donation, or autopsy. For example, TARP and GCI have normal tissue for the entire human body from patients with diseases other than the target disease. In addition, CHTN, NHLBI, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, GCI, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, and the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs also collect blood and/or serum from some patients. NHLBI stores blood sam- ples at BBI for thirteen different studies on blood safety research, the largest one being the Retroviral Epidemiological Study, which is geared toward blood transfusions. NHLBI also stores both blood and tissue at BBI as part of the LAM Registry. Collecting and storing non-diseased matching adjacent tissue, normal tissue, and blood and/or serum samples for comparison to diseased tissue is a best practice.
It is important to note that CHTN and EDRN prospectively collect tissue based on researcher needs. Most of the tissue collected by CHTN is shipped to researchers within four to six weeks of pro- curement (some specimens may be stored for limited periods of time at ultra-low temperatures before distribution to researchers). In addi- tion, some CHTN divisions may store rare tumors and surplus sam- ples until researchers request them. EDRN’s repository design is based on a “just in time” model (i.e., the collection of specimens commences with specific studies to be conducted) and therefore does not entail collecting specimens specifically to bank for future use. Other repositories, such as the LAM Registry, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, and University of Pittsburgh HSTB, collect specimens for both banking purposes and prospectively to meet researcher needs.
All of the repositories store some frozen tissues for varying amounts of time. Some repositories store all of their frozen specimens at –80°C in mechanical freezers (AFIP, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, Ardais), some store all of their frozen specimens in liquid nitrogen (Philadel- phia Familial Breast Cancer Registry), and others store some frozen specimens at –80°C and some in liquid nitrogen (CHTN, NHLBI, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, and GCI). Duke University Breast SPORE stores its frozen
specimens at –135°C in mechanical freezers that have a liquid nitro- gen backup. Most of the repositories also store paraffin-embedded tissue and corresponding slides, and some repositories store fresh tis- sue, blood, serum, and urine.4 For the most part, banked specimens are stored indefinitely or until the specimen is used up.
Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry and NHLBI collect and store primarily blood samples. Blood samples collected by Phila- delphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry are stored at Coriell Cell Re- positories in liquid nitrogen freezers. Blood samples collected by NHLBI are stored at BBI at –80°C in mechanical freezers. Serum samples at GCI are stored in nitrogen vapor freezers organized by dis- ease type. Once processed, sera and plasma are stored at –80°C or colder. DNA is stored in refrigerators (4°C) and freezers (–20°C) equipped with automated retrieval robots (Thurnall system).
Most of the repositories that collect and store paraffin- embedded tissue store the paraffin blocks at room temperature. For example, AFIP stores paraffin blocks in a temperature-controlled warehouse at 21°C (70°F), and Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE stores its paraffin-embedded specimens in a separate temperature-controlled facility. TARP uses paraffin-embedded specimens to make tissue mi- croarrays, which are themselves also constructed in paraffin blocks and then sliced (i.e., sectioned) onto individual slides. Currently, TARP stores all of its paraffin blocks at room temperature in “office- like” conditions. BBI stores paraffin-embedded specimens collected by NHLBI both at room temperature and refrigerated at 4°C.
CHTN, AFIP, and TARP also store specimens on glass slides at room temperature. At AFIP, glass slides are stored at room tempera- ture and are on a rotating retrieval system. TARP is also currently storing its slides at room temperature in closed boxes away from light. However, TARP is developing new recommendations for the storage of slides.
There is no standard for storage of slides at this time, and there is an ongoing debate in the pathology literature about loss of antigen
4 GCI did not initially store specimens embedded in paraffin but started to include such specimens in their collection in response to user requests.
recognition over time. Currently, there are several ways to store slides. Older slides were routinely dipped in paraffin to form a “paraffin overcoat.” Slides are also stored at room temperature in closed boxes away from light. Newer techniques for slide storage involve storing slides under gaseous nitrogen or under vacuum. TARP is moving toward storing slides that are moved often under vacuum, and slides that are put in storage for an extended period under nitrogen.
CHTN stores thousands of specimens at any one time, which is a small percentage of the approximately 60,000 samples it distributes each year. However, most of the tissue is not stored for long, because it is distributed soon after it is collected. CHTN provides specimens that are fresh, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, frozen in cryoembed- ding media such as OCT, touch preps, paraffin blocks, sections on slides, serum, plasma, blood, and urine; preparation is driven by re- searcher requests. The most common preparation request is for sam- ples to be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The demand for paraffin blocks has increased since CHTN was established. The majority of specimens are stored for only a short time after they are collected and before they are distributed to researchers and therefore are stored at
CHTN has received feedback from researchers indicating that as long as samples are snap frozen as quickly as possible in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen, short-term storage at
In the past, specimens used to be stored in vials in the liquid phase of nitrogen (–196°C). This caused the seals to break or the plastic vial to crack and, as a consequence, resulted in
tures to below the glass transition temperature of water (–132°C), all metabolic activity comes to a halt (Committee on Germplasm Re- sources, 1978). Therefore, many think that storage below –132°C provides the best preservation of biospecimen integrity. Paraffin- embedded specimens should be stored under conditions that will pro- tect them from melting or other damage (e.g., by water/humidity or insects).
Freezers at all of the repositories are generally connected to central alarm systems with personnel on site 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or monitored by an alarm company. Most repositories/storage facilities also have backup freezers available at all times. Some reposi- tories have their freezers connected to an emergency generator service. CHTN mechanical freezers utilize a carbon-dioxide backup and are connected to emergency power supplies, and Duke University Breast SPORE utilizes a liquid nitrogen backup.
CHTN Eastern Division has maintenance agreements that pro- vide professional periodic maintenance on all freezers. Morning and evening temperature checks are logged; temperatures are also checked, and alarms attended live throughout the day. An automated dialer system is used to contact on-call personnel for after-hours tem- perature emergencies. The repository also cooperates with University of Pennsylvania Hospital security, which monitors CHTN hallways and calls CHTN staff if there is a problem. Gaskets are cleaned and logged weekly, and the freezers are monitored and recalibrated twice yearly in accordance with National Institute of Standards and Tech- nology (NIST) standards. Backups include carbon dioxide on all freezers, emergency power, backup storage space, and dry ice available at all times. Dual-compressor freezers are used because they keep the temperature more stable during opening and closing of the freezer.
damage, contamination, or complete loss of the specimen. To avoid such ptoblems, it is now common practice to store specimens in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen (Holland et al., 2003).
Coriell Cell Repositories, which is responsible for storage of blood samples collected by Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Regis- try,7 retains one empty liquid nitrogen freezer and one empty me- chanical freezer in the event of a failure. All freezers are alarmed and are on emergency generator service. In addition, there are several re- dundancies in the system, including three storage locations, empty freezers, and three backup generators (two diesel and one gas).
BBI, which is responsible for storage of blood samples and other specimens collected by NHLBI, has computerized real-time tempera- ture monitoring in every freezer. In addition, manual monitoring is done six days per week, the battery condition is monitored weekly, the vents are vacuumed quarterly, and preventive maintenance is done annually. A “validation” protocol is performed on each freezer annually; it involves a six-point temperature test to ensure optimal freezer operation. Staff are always on call in case of equipment mal- function or failure.8 Each liquid nitrogen freezer is hooked up to a supply of liquid nitrogen that can be injected as needed. There is also a large tank with backup liquid nitrogen on site. To prevent large temperature variations, the doors on the liquid nitrogen freezers can- not be open for longer than 30 seconds, and only one tray may be removed at a time. Specimens that are transported or worked on out- side of the storage freezer are kept on dry ice. There are also two backup generators, one of which is sufficient to provide power to the entire building. The entire facility is monitored at all times by secu- rity cameras.
The Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE freezers are in a special room that is monitored by security cameras, alarms, and locks. There is an emergency contact list available to security and facility management
Coriell Cell Repositories collaborates with Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry at Fox Chase Cancer Center, and serves as a storage facility for blood samples and slides cut from paraffin blocks for Philadelphia Familial Cancer Registry, Northern California Coop- erative Family Registry, and Utah Cooperative Breast Cancer Registry.
BBI maintains a list of approximately five people per collection, and not more than one person on that list can be out of town at any given time. There is also a research associate or freezer technician on call at all times for one-week shifts. This person must stay within 30 minutes of either storage building at any given time during his or her shift.
University of Pittsburgh HSTB has a computerized monitoring system for its liquid phase nitrogen vessels that records temperatures in real time for each vessel around the clock. Any alarm that is trig- gered is recorded by the system and alerts the central processing unit of the laboratory, which is manned at all times. Similarly, there is an oxygen-level detection system, which is alarmed and alerts the labora- tory in the same fashion. All of the mechanical freezers are connected to an automatic dial-out paging system that cycles through personnel until a response is made. The technician responding can call the dial- up number and get the status of all freezers and can audibly check what is happening in the area where the freezers are located.
Ardais has two different backup generators to take over immedi- ately if there is ever a loss of power. Staff are notified when this hap- pens, and logs are kept. A maintenance contract on the freezers pro- vides service every six months. One freezer is kept empty and maintained at –80˚C so that if one of the freezers in use had a me- chanical problem, its contents could be moved to the empty freezer. All of GCI’s on-site 4˚C refrigerators and –20˚C, –80˚C, and liquid nitrogen freezers are connected to a central alarm system that is moni- tored at all times by a local alarm company that will notify on-call personnel of temperature fluctuations or power loss. These freezers are also connected to an uninterruptible power-supply system and a natural gas–powered emergency generator. Each of the large freezers equipped with an automated retrieval robot has its own generator. In addition, half of all GCI’s sera, plasma, lymphocytes, and cell lines from each tissue source are stored on site, and half are stored in an off-site storage facility in Maryland, where each freezer is monitored by a local alarm company. GCI receives from the off-site storage fa- cility a monthly report on each freezer showing each freezer’s tem- perature trend throughout the month and whether any alarms oc- curred or adjustments have been made.
Around-the-clock monitoring, weekly maintenance, annual major quality checks of freezers, and freezer backup procedures are
best practices to ensure that specimens are maintained at the neces- sary temperatures and conditions. Freezer maintenance and backup procedures used by these repositories to ensure specimen integrity are:
Monitoring a central alarm by on-site personnel or an alarm company at all hours with on-call personnel for after-hours emergencies.
Connecting freezers to backup generators or a liquid nitrogen backup.
Establishing maintenance agreements with professional periodic maintenance.
Developing SOPs for daily/weekly/monthly/yearly maintenance
Logging of morning and evening temperature checks
Weekly cleaning of gaskets
Professional maintenance twice yearly
Yearly calibration.
Maintaining enough empty freezer space to allow for quick transfer of specimens from malfunctioning freezers.
Using multiple storage sites—either on site (i.e., divided be- tween two or more freezers) or at both on-site and off-site loca- tions.
Quality control, auditing, and standardization during the storage of tissues are well defined at Coriell Cell Repositories (CCR) and BBI, repositories that routinely store large numbers of tissues under col- laborative/contractual agreements with institutions collecting tissues. AFIP, which stores over 90 million specimens, has a standard proto- col that is followed during the processing and storage of specimens. Ardais and GCI, both of which were specifically designed to collect and store specimens for distribution to customers/researchers, use bar codes to track specimens throughout storage and other operational processes.
rigorous standards for storage, including storing specimens in multi- ple locations, sorting specimens while still submerged in liquid nitro- gen to avoid temperature fluctuations, and retaining a portion of the specimen in the original container as a primary identifier. CCR has developed numerous SOPs for freezing and storage of specimens, in- cluding freezing a biopsy, assigning frozen ampoules a freeze location and storing the ampoules in their assigned locations, checking sealed glass ampoules for leaks prior to long-term storage in liquid nitrogen, and locating and retrieving ampoules in the liquid nitrogen storage tanks. As part of its ISO9000 certification, CCR performs periodic audits of its inventory to verify the location, identity, and quality of the specimens in storage. CHTN also does annual physical invento- ries, even though it does not tend to store most specimens for years.
BBI, which stores specimens for NHLBI, has established proce- dures for the receipt of every kind of specimen. The quality of a specimen is checked and confirmed upon arrival by a research associ- ate. A second research associate confirms the permanent location on forms during inventory. This location is entered into the computer by laboratory personnel and confirmed by a manager. Two sets of independent data are generated and compared to verify that they match before a specimen is committed to inventory. In addition, many of the specimens at BBI are bar coded.9
AFIP follows a standard protocol for the processing and storage of each specimen. Specimens arrive in Repository and Research Serv- ices and are given a seven-digit AFIP number. Each specimen is checked three times to make sure that the AFIP number and the specimen match. Technicians enter the number and the data into the computer, and a lead technician checks the data and releases it to various departments where the receiving secretary checks that the number and the specimen match.
Three years ago, University of Pittsburgh HSTB performed a year-long audit of its system to make sure that everything was stored where it was supposed to be. Tissue that had been used up, tissue
9 BBI intends to eventually label all specimens with bar codes.
At Ardais, all specimens and the boxes in which they are stored are bar coded. The bar code is used to track the exact locations of specimens in the freezers. When specimens arrive at Ardais, each specimen and the container are scanned. As specimens are pulled or moved to consolidate boxes, the specimens and the boxes are scanned. In this way, the location of each specimen is always known. The repository is also subject to random audits by Ardais corporate auditors to check that each specimen is accounted for.
GCI employs a system of scannable bar codes to track and man- age the specimens in the repository. When the specimens arrive they are checked against information provided by collection sites. Serum and DNA samples undergo a multiple-step process to determine their quality and concentration and to verify their identity, which is usually done by testing certain genetic markers to confirm characteristics, such as sex. If the samples meet these criteria, they undergo additional procedures to standardize their concentrations and volumes. At each point in the process, automatic checks are done to verify the sample’s coded identity.
Repositories that store specimens for extended periods of time conduct additional tests on or checks of the specimens after the initial characterization and verification procedures. Often these are per- formed before the specimen is distributed to researchers. Before tissue is sent to customers, Ardais pathologists perform a verification of each sample via H&amp;E staining to ensure that the sample identity is correct and the sample pathology is consistent with the pathology report from the submitting hospital. All samples are annotated with addi- tional, internally generated pathology data, including digital images, which are available on line. At GCI, new slides are periodically made from existing frozen or paraffin-embedded specimens to check for specimen integrity. University of Pittsburgh HSTB monitors the RNA integrity of its specimens. Periodically auditing, performing in- ventories, and certifying the location, identity, and quality of speci- mens is a best practice.
The repositories vary greatly in how many tissue samples they distrib- ute every year. The government and industry repositories (EDRN, TARP, CHTN, GCI, Ardais, and NHLBI) distribute significantly more tissue samples than do the repositories associated with academic medical centers (tens of thousands versus hundreds to thousands) (see Table 3.3 for more detail). Since 1987, CHTN has distributed nearly 500,000 specimens to more than 1,000 different researchers, includ- ing 49,000 samples in 2002 and 62,000 samples in 2001. Eighty per- cent of these researchers are in academic or government institutions, the other 20 percent are in industry. TARP distributes 1,250 slides per year through CHTN to 125 researchers, of whom approximately 60 percent are academic, 20 percent NIH, and 20 percent industry. Ardais expects that approximately 5,000 to 7,000 tissue samples will be distributed in 2003 to its partner medical centers, other academic institutes, and biotech and pharmaceutical companies. GCI distrib- uted about 400 tissue samples, 800 serum samples, 100 RNA sam- ples, and 15,000 DNA samples to industry and academic and gov- ernmental organizations. Roughly 65 percent of GCI’s end-users fell into the industry category.
Over the course of the Duke University repository’s life, more than 1,000 tissues and tens of thousands of blood samples and slides have been distributed, averaging approximately 100 samples per year. Eighty percent were distributed to academicians, while 20 percent were distributed to government. There was no distribution to indus- try. Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE distributed between 250 and 300 samples in 2002, primarily to researchers at Mayo (90 to 95 percent). About 3 percent of the Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE samples were distributed to other academic/not-for-profit researchers, and the re- maining 2 percent were distributed to researchers in industry. Last year, 1,500 patient samples were supplied by University of Pittsburgh HSTB to University of Pittsburgh researchers (10 to 15 grants), about 10 percent of which were distributed as part of sponsored re- search agreements with commercial users.
At the other end of the spectrum is the NHLBI LAM study. It has distributed tissue to only two researchers, partly because of the rare nature of the tissue and the goals of the registry. AFIP also dis- tributes very little tissue to outside requesters (two to three requests are approved per year), in part because many requesters are not will- ing to pay the costs of identifying and preparing the tissues for re- lease. Tissue is shared more often when AFIP staff members are col- laborators on protocols.
One of the main reasons for the large differences in the quanti- ties of specimens distributed to external researchers is that specimen distribution practices clearly depend on the mission of the repository. If the mission is clearly defined, and the repository evaluates its ability to meet its goals and is willing to change policies, procedures, and practices when the goals are not being met, then this is sufficient.
Most of the repositories use similar procedures to ship samples to re- searchers and to ship specimens from collection sites to the repository (see subsection entitled Centralized Versus Decentralized Collection and Storage, above). Frozen samples are shipped on dry ice, and par- affin blocks and slides are sent at room temperature via overnight car- rier according to IATA shipping regulations. Repositories that pro- vide fresh tissue to researchers, such as CHTN and LAM Registry, ship samples on wet ice or cold packs directly from the collection site where the tissue was obtained.
Shipments to researchers include a shipping manifest, which usually contains a list of sample identification (ID) numbers and de- scriptions of the samples shipped. At CHTN, procured tissue is as- signed to a researcher, and the assignment is verified to confirm that it is an appropriate match. When the shipment is set up, the suitabil- ity of the specimen for the researchers’ requirements is checked again. At the time shipment is set up, the shipping address and shipping ac- count numbers are verified with the researcher and the database. At the time of shipment to the researcher, labels and pathology reports are verified against the packing list to make sure that all of the infor- mation is consistent and correct. Essentially, every step of the process
is subject to verification. CHTN and CCR also include a feedback questionnaire in each shipment that asks researchers about the quality of the samples received.
The use of standardized protocols for collection, processing, storage, and distribution of specimens, and common data elements (CDEs) for the annotation of specimens at individual network participant lo- cations makes comparative research across participating institutions possible and is a best practice. In addition, QA must be multitiered and fully integrated to be effective. The components of a QA strategy should include:
Train all personnel who are involved in the collection, process- ing, annotation, storage, and distribution of tissue.
Standardize collection, processing, annotation, storage, and dis- tribution protocols to ensure the highest quality samples and comparability of research results.
Perform appropriate QC testing on each specimen, such as histopatholgy (H&amp;E), immunohistochemistry, testing for DNA/RNA integrity, and other QC testing as appropriate.
Bar-code specimens and data so that it is easy both to match the specimen with the pathology report and other associated data and to locate the specimen in the storage facility.
Use researcher feedback about sample quality to re-examine QC procedures.
Best practices for specimen collection, processing, annotation, and distribution clearly depend on the mission of the repository. If the mission is clearly defined, and the repository evaluates its ability to meet its goals and is willing to change its policies, procedures, and practices when those goals are not being met, then this is sufficient.
Collect tissue from ethnically diverse populations of all ages to ensure that the tissue available for research purposes is diverse and demographically representative of the population, and to expand biomedical research to include understudied/under- represented populations. Most of the repositories collect tissue from ethnically diverse populations. CHTN, TARP, EDRN, AFIP, and University of Pittsburgh HSTB collect specimens from children. TARP collaborative studies, EDRN, the Philadel- phia Familial Breast Cancer Registries, AFIP, and GCI collect specimens from other countries, such as Belgium, Canada, China, India, Israel, Poland, Tunisia, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam (see Table 3.1, above).
Build a network of academic medical centers and community hospitals to provide the number of high-quality samples and data needed for research purposes. CHTN, TARP, EDRN, Philadel- phia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, AFIP, and GCI have es- tablished networks of collection sites for the collection of a wide variety of tissue.
To ensure that patient care is not compromised, allow patholo- gists to determine what tissue is necessary for pathologic diagno- sis and what is excess and can be given to the repository for stor- age and research use. This is done at all of the repositories.
Use standardized and carefully monitored shipping procedures with systems to track all shipments and expected receipts. CHTN, NHLBI, Ardais, and GCI carefully monitor shipping procedures.
To ensure specimen quality, match the tissue received with the pathology report and other documents provided with it, and
have a pathologist review an H&amp;E stained slide made from each specimen. Most of the repositories verify the integrity of every tissue specimen after collection: CHTN, TARP, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, Duke University Breast SPORE, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI.
Use an electronic tracking system, such as scannable bar codes or other, new electronic technologies, to track specimens and asso- ciated information from the time of collection through the time of distribution. BBI, Ardais, and GCI use a bar-code tracking system, and University of Pittsburgh HSTB has recently imple- mented a bar-coding system.
Develop standard operating procedures for the repository’s col- lection of specimens to allow experimental comparisons. CHTN, TARP, EDRN, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI have all developed standard protocols for biospecimen collection.
Train collection personnel and supply them with standard proto- cols to follow in order to provide comparable specimens for re- search purposes. CHTN, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, Ardais, and GCI all train repository personnel to collect and process biospecimens.
Ensure standards at institutions that contribute specimens to the repository through close contact with collection site personnel. CHTN, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, and Ardais maintain close contact with collection-site personnel. This is also true of TARP, since the specimens used to make the TARP microarrays are collected by CHTN.
Procure and process specimens for storage within one hour post- excision using detailed, standardized protocols. CHTN, Duke University Breast SPORE, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI procure and process most specimens for storage
within one hour post-excision. The UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs collect some specimens from most patients within one hour post-excision.
Utilize pathologists to confirm the identity and diagnosis of bio- specimens collected by the repository and to make further anno- tations concerning any unusual characteristics to ensure detailed accurate information on all specimens. CHTN, TARP, Philadel- phia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, the Duke University Breast SPORE, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, Ardais, and GCI all do this.
Link all results and annotations gathered from H&amp;E stained slides or from any other assays or tests performed on the speci- mens upon arrival and throughout their life at the repository to the specimens and provide this information to researchers. This practice is followed to some extent by all of the repositories.
Provide any information about the specimen obtained during the quality control histopathologic examination and tissue charac- terization (including digital images of stained slides, when ap- propriate) in a database for researchers to access. Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, and Ardais provide information and digital images to researchers in their da- tabases.
Collect consistent and high-quality data associated with bio- specimens and employ a standardized set of common data ele- ments that are collected with every biospecimen. The use of common data elements makes comparative research possible across the approximately 40 institutions participating in EDRN and the six institutions participating in the Breast and Ovarian CFRs.
Collect complete data on all elements in a minimal data set de- signed to fulfill the mission of the repository and meet the needs of its users. Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, Uni- versity of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI collect extensive demographic and pathologic data, family history, medical his- tory, lifestyle and diet history, treatment, and clinical outcomes.
Collect and store longitudinal data, following applicable consent requirements. Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, EDRN, all of the SPOREs, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, and GCI routinely collect clinical outcomes and longitudinal data about tissue sources. Longitudinal data are collected through an- nual questionnaires, tumor registries, or directly from medical re- cords. The tissue sources for these resources have consented to this follow-up. All of the repositories collect longitudinal data to varying degrees.
Ensure the accuracy of data entry through the use of standard- ized terminology and computer data-entry forms (e.g., drop- down menus) whenever possible. These practices are used by CHTN, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI.
Implement one or more independent checks of the data once they are entered into the repository database. Most of the reposi- tories perform independent checks of data for accuracy and completeness.
Collect non-diseased matching adjacent tissue, normal tissue, and blood/serum samples for comparison to diseased tissue. All of the repositories except AFIP, NHLBI, and Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry collect non-diseased matching adjacent tissue and matching normal tissue controls, and TARP and GCI have normal tissue for the entire human body from patients with diseases other than the target disease.
Develop standards for storage depending on tissue type and pres- ervation condition (e.g., snap frozen, paraffin embedded, tissue microarray). This practice exists in several repositories but should be “industrywide.” However, there is no consensus on the opti- mum storage condition for specimens. Storage for frozen speci- mens ranges from –80˚C in mechanical freezers to –150˚C in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen. Many think that storage at lower temperatures helps preserve the integrity of the specimens for long-term storage. Paraffin-embedded specimens should be
Monitor specimens around the clock, perform weekly mainte- nance and annual major quality checks of freezers, and use freezer backup procedures to ensure that specimens are main- tained at the necessary temperature and condition. BBI and CCR provide excellent examples of these practices.
Use multiple storage sites—either on site (i.e., divided between two or more freezers) or at both on-site and off-site locations. CHTN, CCR, and GCI use multiple storage sites.
Periodically audit, inventory, and certify the location, identity, and quality of specimens to maintain the value of the specimens in the repositories. CHTN, CCR, BBI, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI employ auditing and inventory and monitor the quality of their specimens.
Use standardized protocols for collection, storage, processing, and distribution of specimens and use common data elements for the annotation of specimens at individual network participant locations in order to make comparative research across partici- pating institutions possible.
Ensure multitiered, fully integrated quality assurance, including the following:
Train all personnel who are involved in the collection, proc- essing, annotation, storage, and distribution of tissue.
Standardize collection, processing, annotation, storage, and distribution protocols to ensure the highest quality specimens and comparability of research results.
Perform appropriate quality control testing on each specimen, such as histopatholgy (H&amp;E), immunohistochemistry, testing for DNA/RNA integrity, and other quality control testing as appropriate.
Bar-scode specimens and data so that it is easy both to match the specimen with the pathology report and other associated data and to locate the specimen in the storage facility.
Use researcher feedback about sample quality to re-examine quality control procedures.
A critical part of the design of a tissue repository is the bioinformatics and data management system. Bioinformatics is an evolving discipline that has been defined in several ways, but all definitions emphasize the use of computer and statistical methods to understand biological data.1 Bioinformatics often refers to research involving genomics, the study of the genes and their function in a genome, and proteomics, the study of proteins and their function in the genome.2
The RAND interview instrument addressed questions regarding the use of bioinformatics systems at the sites, including standardiza- tion of data reporting, data searching and mining capabilities, acces- sibility of data (for researchers, managers, physicians, patients, and the public), network security, and information technology (IT) per- sonnel. All of the repositories had systems that exhibited data stan- dardization, restricted accessibility to data, and multiple security methods, but few of the repositories were designed to share informa- tion broadly or to feed research results back into the database. Spe- cific findings from the interviews are described, along with best prac- tices identified by the RAND research team.

All of the repositories use their bioinformatics systems as repository inventory management tools for tracking collection, processing, and distribution of tissue specimens (see Table 4.1). Most of the reposito- ries also use their bioinformatics systems as tools to manage patho- logical and clinical information about the specimens, such as demo- graphic and histopathological information and clinical/outcomes information. At some repositories, immunohistochemistry (IHC) images and research results are also included in the bioinformatics systems (TARP, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, University of Pitts- burgh HSTB, and GCI). The CHTN informatics system serves as both a standard repository management tool and a central reference database to allow real-time communication about researcher requests and to help CHTN divisions locate samples researchers need from other divisions. CHTN is in the process of upgrading to a Web-based system. The bioinformatics systems at some repositories are also used to de-identify the specimens (CHTN, University of Pittsburgh HSTB).
The bioinformatics systems range from simple Microsoft Ac- cess® databases (Duke University Breast SPORE, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs), to proprietary systems developed in house (TARP, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, AFIP, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, and GCI), to systems developed with the help of contractors (CHTN, EDRN, NHLBI, and Ardais). University of Pittsburgh HSTB and Ardais use an Oracle framework for their bioinformatics databases. Currently, University of Pittsburgh HSTB uses Access® to “manage” the reposi- tory. However, it is in the process of converting the Access® tables to an inventory system developed in house that interfaces with its Pa- thology Software (CoPath) and its organ specific database (OSD), and will report tissue utilization by organ or investigator and allow for specimen tracking and data mining. Ardais uses Business Objects® software as a reporting and data mining tool, and uses Web-deployed interfaces for repository management transactions. Ardais initially

bThe bioinformatics system at the Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Family Registry is not Web based. However, the centralized bioinformatics system at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), which is utilized by the Breast and Ovarian CFRs, is Web-based, and the information collected by Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Family Registry is downloaded to the UCI system via the Web.
used contractors but found that close interaction between users (re- searchers, hospital employees, and Ardais staff) and the IT group was required to make the system work well. Ardais has now completely integrated informatics personnel with all operational components of the system—from the medical centers, through internal operations, to distribution. Similarly, GCI and University of Pittsburgh HSTB have IT staff working closely with researchers to develop the systems. In most cases, IT personnel are actually co-located with users. Close ties between the bioinformatics system developers, researchers, data man- agers, and repository management is a best practice. The following repositories exhibit this relationship: CHTN, TARP, EDRN, NHLBI, AFIP, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, University of Pitts- burgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI.
Several repositories use a standardized language to categorize and describe biospecimens and enter data into the bioinformatics system. For instance, AFIP and GCI use the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED®) coding, and Ardais uses a SNOMED®- based ontology.3 The cancer registrar for each organ system working with University of Pittsburgh HSTB uses NAACCR standards for clinical annotations to the specimens. The UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs found that SNOMED® and NAACCR had redundant di- agnoses, so they developed a non-redundant version to use. CHTN uses standard tissue coding developed by CHTN pathologists, which is closely tied to the clinical process flow and is designed to minimize user interpretation. TARP uses standard U.S. pathology nomencla- ture and alternative names where appropriate. EDRN uses the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) systems of classifica- tion of cancer, NAACCR, and NCI’s Metathesaurus, which is based on the National Library of Medicine’s Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus and is supplemented with additional cancer- centric vocabulary. Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry uses a modified version of the standardized form developed by the regis- try’s Pathology Working Group.
It is important to note that SNOMED is a redundant language and does not provide stan- dard data elements.
In addition to using standardized nomenclature, sites have vari- ous means of ensuring standardization. At Ardais, the surgical pathol- ogy data are abstracted and transferred into the Biomaterials and Information for Genomic Research (BIGR™)4 system by a trained pathologist using drop-down menus to ensure standard data entry. Ardais pathologists work from printed SOPs providing interpretation rules during the abstraction of the pathology report. Some of the re- positories were set up to allow, or are testing the ability of, the medi- cal informatics system located at the collection site to interface with the repository’s bioinformatics system (CHTN, EDRN, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, and Ardais). The University of Pittsburgh HSTB system automatically accesses the surgical pathology report, the cancer registry, and the repository database and extracts data for the bioin- formatics system. In some cases where the data are entered manually (NHLBI and GCI), two people verify the entry. Using either an automated data extraction system or multiple checks of data entry as well as accepted standard language and drop-down menus in the bio- informatics system is a best practice.
None of the repositories collect genomics/proteomics data as a primary function. University of Pittsburgh HSTB has performed gene expression analysis by DNA microarray using Affymetrix GeneChips® on 100 prostate tissue samples as part of a pilot study of 200 cases. These results and those from researchers who conduct DNA microarray experiments on other tissue samples distributed from University of Pittsburgh HSTB are entered into the bioinfor- matics system and are available for all researchers to analyze in “in silico” experiments.5 University of Pittsburgh HSTB is also part of
BIGR™ is the name of the Ardais bioinformatics system.

the Pennsylvania Cancer Alliance, a consortium of six medical and cancer research centers in Pennsylvania. Data across the six centers, including DNA microarray data, are being integrated based on the University of Pittsburgh HSTB’s bioinformatics model. The Web- based system allows researchers to search across all six centers to find tissue for their projects.
Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry has a supplemental grant to do some genotyping for BRCA1 and BRCA2 and plans to eventually have everyone in the registry genotyped. At Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, tissue samples are used for a variety of purposes, and when a researcher performs DNA or RNA analysis of a sample, the information is added to the bioinformatics system. EDRN is planning to create a data warehouse for genomics/proteomics data. Ardais has a two-year grant from NIST to develop a clinical genomics database using structured data domains to collect clinically relevant information for tissue samples.
Only the Breast and Ovarian CFRs, EDRN, the University of Pittsburgh HSTB genomics project, GCI, and Duke University Breast SPORE currently feed data from research on their samples back into the repository data system. Duke’s feedback includes only research performed by the initiator of the repository and others closely associated with it. Results from collaborative validation studies are stored in the EDRN bioinformatics system. GCI stores research and assay results, but that information is only available to internal researchers and collaborators. A best practice for bioinformatics sys- tems is feeding standard research results and genomics and pro- teomics results back into the system for other researchers to access.
All of the bioinformatics systems are searchable and many databases are Web based (see Table 4.1). Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE elected

not to use a Web-based system, for data security reasons. In some cases, researchers have access to some data (TARP, EDRN, NHLBI, AFIP, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, and Ardais); but in others, Data Coordinating Centers or other data managers retain sole access (CHTN, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, Duke Univer- sity Breast SPORE, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, and GCI). For instance, TARP posts arrays that are available on line, and the database is fully searchable for col- laborative studies. The system is similar at Ardais, where the BIGR™ system is searchable by both researchers and staff and provides a uni- fied view of specimens stored at any of the repository sites. Specimens can be searched for using a variety of tissue format, sample finding, and case diagnosis characteristics. In contrast, the Mayo Clinic Pros- tate SPORE and the CHTN databases cannot be directly searched by researchers. At Mayo, researchers submit questions to the Depart- ment of Urology to get approval, and the bioinformatics technicians perform the actual search. At CHTN, staff can query for specific tis- sues, for statistics about tissues collected, stored, and distributed, and for characteristics about the tissue.
The type of information that is available for searching varies depending on the repository. Almost all of the repository databases include basic pathology data and may also include patient demo- graphics. In some cases, searches can be performed on clinical and outcomes data associated with the specimens.
With the exception of CHTN and Duke University Breast SPORE, the data repositories are set up for data mining (sorting through data to identify patterns and establish relationships), but the data that can be mined are limited to specific sets for each repository. The NHLBI LAM, Ardais, and GCI databases were specifically cre- ated to allow data mining and advanced statistical analysis to find use- ful patterns and relationships. For example, the Ardais bioinformatics system can be mined for quantitative, structured clinical data (e.g., demographics, diagnosis, clinical stage, grade, nodal status, pathol- ogy, and sample cellular composition) using both available and modi- fiable high-level and low-level application programming interfaces (APIs). The University of Pittsburgh HSTB system was designed to
allow researchers to combine and analyze data from DNA microarray experiments performed by different scientists.
A bioinformatics system that is searchable and minable via varying levels of Web-based access for different individuals (including repository personnel, researchers, patients, and the public) is a best practice. To protect the privacy of the tissue sources, the appropriate level of access for different personnel should be addressed by the IRB or bioethics advisory board.
Most of the repositories exercise access control to their data, allowing researchers, physicians, and others access to limited data, such as the number of specimens of a specific type of cancer, while maintaining strict control over the ability to manipulate the data. Several reposito- ries, including CHTN, GCI, and the Mayo Clinic and Duke Univer- sity SPOREs allow only their staff access to the data. The Ardais sys- tem permits both role-based and user-based restrictions to be set by administrators. None of the repositories shares its data publicly.
All of the repositories use both electronic and physical means to protect the data. Because the interviews for this study were conducted primarily with physicians and researchers, RAND did not gather de- tailed information about the physical and network security. At a minimum, each repository uses firewalls and passwords to prevent unauthorized access. Several network security systems are quite so- phisticated and include biometrics, encryption, and intrusion detec- tion systems. Most of the university-based systems are physically housed with the university servers and include all of their security measures. Employing network security systems and access control to ensure that privacy is protected and that the bioinformatics system is secure is a best practice.6

Each site uses specific processes to ensure and audit quality and stan- dardize data for entry into its systems. Some of the repositories that inherited specimens or have specimens from older studies conducted before the formal repositories were initiated include non-standard information, but often the value (or potential value) of the specimens has led to the specimens and associated data in the bioinformatics system being maintained. Some of the sites manually double or triple check the data entered into their systems using independent techni- cians or researchers. The other sites rely on automated software or random or requested checks to validate their data.
Maintain close ties between the bioinformatics system developers, the researchers, the data managers, and repository management. The following repositories exhibit this relationship: CHTN, TARP, EDRN, NHLBI, AFIP, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI.
Use either an automated data extraction system or multiple checks of data entry, accepted standard language, and drop-down menus in the bioinformatics system. CHTN uses standard language and drop-down menus, as well as multiple checks and automated parsing to verify the data entered into its database. NHLBI and GCI perform multiple checks of data entry. AFIP uses SNOMED® coding for its bioinformatics system, and University of Pittsburgh HSTB uses NAACCR coding. University of Pitts- burgh HSTB has developed an organ specific database (OSD) in- tegration engine to interface with the tissue bank inventory system that automatically extracts data from the surgical pathology report and the cancer registry. Ardais employs pathologists to abstract the surgical pathology report using printed SOPs that provide inter- pretation rules and to enter the information into the Ardais
Enter standard research results and genomics and proteomics re- sults into the bioinformatics system for other researchers to access. EDRN stores results from collaborative validation studies in its bioinformatics system. The University of Pittsburgh HSTB OSD integration engine includes results from in-house and other re- searchers’ DNA microarray experiments. GCI includes results of assays in its database, but the GCI database is only accessible for internal research and to collaborators. Duke University Breast SPORE feeds back some research results into its database, but only from researchers closely affiliated with the repository.
Develop and use a bioinformatics system that is searchable and minable using varying levels of Web-based access for different in- dividuals (including repository personnel, researchers, patients, and the public). The EDRN database is searchable and minable on line through the EDRN secure site, which is available to all EDRN members and those who request special permission. The NHLBI database is designed for data mining, but only by the data coordinating center. Some parts of the University of Pittsburgh HSTB inventory system are accessible over the Web and are mi- nable. This system is available to researchers requesting tissue and is the model for a statewide system of data sharing among six can- cer research sites in Pennsylvania. Ardais developed a Web-based interface for its BIGR™ system that has multiple levels of access and is minable and available to researchers and staff. The bioin- formatics system at GCI was specifically designed to be minable.
Employ network security systems and access control to ensure that privacy is protected and that the bioinformatics system is secure. All of the repositories use both electronic and physical means to protect the data.
Ensuring that a repository meets its user needs involves continual self- assessment and re-evaluation. Repository users in the academic, gov- ernment, and industry sectors may have different needs or impose different kinds of demands on their repositories. It is important, therefore, to analyze each repository in terms of its initial design and intent as well as its actual customer profile and demonstrated effec- tiveness.
The consumers of biospecimen repositories include academia, gov- ernment, and industry. In general, the commercial reposito- ries—Ardais and GCI—sent a higher percentage of their biospeci- mens to industry than did the academic centers (see Table 5.1). GCI’s mission is to conduct collaborative research internally using in- house and other (primarily academic) laboratories. A subset of GCI’s banked specimens is, therefore, used for this purpose (see discussion below). GCI reported distributing approximately 400 tissue samples in the past year (a moderate number compared to that of the other repositories evaluated). In comparison, Ardais expects to have distrib- uted between 5,000 and 7,000 samples by the end of 2003 (see Chapter Three, Table 3.3). At University of Pittsburgh HSTB, which
reported distributing 2,500 samples last year, less than 10 percent of those samples were distributed to industry users as part of sponsored research agreements. These industry partnerships are focused on spe- cific research projects, and the actual research is often conducted by UPMC researchers. Among the non-commercial repositories evalu- ated, NHLBI LAM Registry and Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry distributed samples almost exclusively to academic research- ers (100 percent and ~99 percent, respectively), although both reposi- tories have distributed fewer than 30 samples. Approximately 30,000 samples per year are distributed from other NHLBI collections to primarily academic and government researchers. AFIP’s samples are distributed only to academic and government users. CHTN, which distributed more than 62,000 samples in 2001, reported that 80 per- cent of its samples went to academic and/or government users. (CHTN Eastern Division distributed 32 percent of its samples to in- dustry, slightly more than CHTN as a whole.)
Several of the repositories evaluated conduct or support internal re- search using samples stored at their facilities. Two of the academic- based repositories (Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE and University of Pittsburgh HSTB) distribute the majority of their tissue (&gt;90 per- cent) within the collecting university. Duke University Breast SPORE distributes ~50 percent of its tissue outside the university (see Table 5.1). The UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs are in the process of building their inventory and allowing the specimens to “mature” (i.e., keeping the specimens in storage for three to four years to allow adequate time for the collection of clinical outcomes and longitudinal data) and are not currently distributing many specimens. Their goal, when they start distributing, is to distribute at least 30 percent of the tissue outside UAB. Among the non-academic repositories, GCI con- ducts the most internal research with its specimens. The repository was designed primarily to facilitate collaborative research that uses human biospecimens, and GCI runs the fee-for-service side of the company (i.e., distributing biospecimen samples for use in research) to support its research endeavors. No exact figures were obtained re-
garding the proportion of samples distributed to internal researchers or collaborators at GCI.
Unlike GCI, Ardais does not conduct internal research on its specimens apart from that used to develop new customer services. The question of internal versus external use of samples for research does not apply to places such as CHTN or EDRN, where samples are not kept at any one location or for any particular institution. Any re- searcher who is a part of EDRN may access samples from any of the networked repositories.
CHTN, TARP, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI all set some goals for tissue col- lection or are trying to keep their stocks replenished to keep up with customer demand. CHTN primarily collects tissue prospectively to distribute to researchers based on their requests. CHTN routinely solicits feedback from researchers who use the repository to assess whether their needs are being met. A subcommittee of the coordi- nating committee reviews difficult researcher requests and tries to find novel methods for obtaining such specimens. CHTN is continu- ally establishing relationships with new collection sites and looking for ways to increase the types of tissue that are in short supply. Some specimens are collected and stored in anticipation of demand, in- cluding rare specimens, excess specimens not needed immediately, and specimens from pediatric patients. Likewise, the EDRN reposi- tory is designed based on a “just in time” model and therefore does not collect specimens specifically to bank for future use.
TARP attempts to keep an adequate supply of specimens of the tissue types that are in constant demand, such as breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer. TARP has a goal of maintaining between 75 and 100 different specimens each of breast, ovarian, colon, and prostate can- cers. The greatest challenge is obtaining enough prostate cancer specimens, because they are in high demand and the amount of tissue removed is very small. TARP is actively expanding its renal cell carci- noma and pancreatic cancer collections, two of the most requested but frequently unavailable tumors. It does not currently have ade-
The UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs are actively trying to collect many specimens (e.g., 2,000 to 3,000 specimens of breast can- cer) to have enough heterogeneity (variety) in tumor types, patient medical histories, and clinical outcomes. In addition, UAB wants to enrich its collection with more specimens from minority populations and unusual subtypes of breast and ovarian cancer.
University of Pittsburgh HSTB has targeted, organ-focused col- lections of all resected tumors from consented patients in the areas of brain, breast, head and neck, lung, melanoma, pancreas, pediatric tumors, and prostate through NIH-funded research programs. In ad- dition, University of Pittsburgh HSTB has IRB approval to collect all resections from all tissue that comes into the surgical pathology de- partment that would otherwise be discarded. Currently, University of Pittsburgh HSTB’s supply far exceeds the demand for tissue.
Ardais attempts to keep an adequate supply of specimens to keep up with customer/researcher demand but does not set an exact number of specimens it needs to collect. If more or less of a particular type of specimen is needed, this is communicated monthly to the staff at the collection sites, in particular to the nurses who contact the patients. Goals are set and detailed forecasting is performed to deter- mine if these goals will be met. Regular reports are generated detail- ing numbers and types of tissue samples distributed to customers and collected from medical institutes so that collection priorities can be quickly changed to match customer demand.
Assessing the needs of researchers, tracking the numbers and types of tissue samples distributed, and using this information to quickly change collection priorities to match customer demand is a best practice. For instance, CHTN actively adapts to researcher needs in a variety of ways to ensure it collects the types of tissue needed. Ardais also adapts to researcher requests monthly using re- porting and modeling. Likewise, GCI collects tissue specimens daily to keep its stock of tissue replenished. A quarterly assessment of user requests is performed so that target levels can be constantly adjusted.
The review and prioritization systems for tissue requests at academic and commercial repositories have similarities, while those at govern- ment repositories are somewhat different. There seem to be four gen- eral approaches: (1) first come, first served; (2) priority to members of the network, collaborators, and/or contributors to the repository; (3) prioritization based on merit review of research proposals; and (4) prioritization based on a set policy of the repository. The commercial repositories evaluated distribute tissue on a first come, first served ba- sis. However, researchers at institutions that are collection sites for these commercial repositories receive some level of priority for tissue distribution over other researchers. For instance, at Ardais, 10 to 20 percent of collected tissue is reserved for researchers from the submit- ting institution. At GCI the system is not as formalized, although re- searchers at institutions that are involved in the collection of speci- mens are given a slight priority. Likewise, some academic repositories give priority to researchers at their institutions over other researchers. For example, members of the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs get first priority over SPORE members at other institutions and non- SPORE researchers. University of Pittsburgh researchers whose grants support the collection of tissue for the HSTB have priority over oth- ers. In this way, the needs of researchers at collecting institutions are supported by the tissue collection effort, which ultimately leads to more support for the resource and higher investment in the quality of the specimens collected—a policy that is considered a best practice.
At CHTN and TARP,1 samples are provided according to CHTN’s priority policy as follows: (1) first priority is assigned to peer-reviewed funded researchers, including researchers from federal and national laboratories; (2) second priority is assigned to develop- mental and new researchers and to researchers developing new proj- ects in academic centers or non-profit research institutions; and (3) third priority is assigned to other researchers, including those associ-

ated with for-profit research institutions. Each CHTN division is al- lowed some discretion in determining special exemptions to the pri- ority policy. Researchers at EDRN laboratories and centers have pri- ority over other researchers for the tissues collected by EDRN, but all requests are subject to a seven-point criteria review by a prioritization subcommittee. This review takes into account scientific merit, study design, technical parameters (e.g., reproducibility, sensitivity, speci- ficity, throughput, automation, and cost), clinical or scientific im- pact, portfolio balance with EDRN, practicality and feasibility (e.g., amount of tissue, and number of samples required), and collaborative strength. Similarly, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs give prior- ity to SPORE members at their institutions, then to SPORE mem- bers at other institutions, and finally to other researchers whose proj- ects merit the special use of the specimens and data collected by the SPOREs. The Breast and Ovarian Cancer Registries, of which Phila- delphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry is a member, collaboratively share their resources with researchers based on the merit of the re- searchers’ proposals.
At most academic and some government repositories, researchers making large tissue requests or requests for rare tissue must first get approval from a biospecimen committee. Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE refers all large requests to its SPORE Biospecimen Group, which then prioritizes all the requests (in contrast to small requests, which are handled by the pathologist or RN who heads the reposi- tory). At University of Pittsburgh HSTB, the process is similar, with large requests going to a tissue utilization committee that is specific to the type of tissue requested and made up of, among others, physi- cians, researchers, and administrators. The portion of Ardais’s reposi- tory that is restricted for use only by the donating medical centers is subject to merit review by internal committees. The use of a tissue utilization committee to prioritize tissue distribution based on merit review of all research proposals using standardized criteria, and to en- sure equitable distribution of tissue is a best practice.
In most cases, the procedure for prioritizing requests for rare or precious tissue is the same as that used for easily available tissue. CHTN, NHLBI, Ardais, and Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE also
mentioned specific policies for regulating the distribution of the last sample of a particular specimen or for limiting the control of an en- tire specimen or type of specimen by a single researcher. These types of “last file” or single-user policies are a best practice.
Meeting user needs may require different approaches depending on a repository’s design, customer profile, and product offerings. At a re- pository like CHTN, where specimens are collected in response to specific researcher requests, unmet user needs generally fall into one of three categories: (1) impossible requests, such as those for ex- tremely large amounts of tissue; (2) impossible constraints, such as requests for tissue collected under unreasonable conditions; or (3) requests for extremely rare tissue. In general these challenges existed at all the repositories evaluated. CHTN Eastern Division voiced re- lated concerns, citing the trend toward early detection of cancers and the use of new technologies that allow for less invasive or more tar- geted tumor removal procedures, which results in an overall decrease in the availability of cancer tissue. These challenges differ depending on the specialization of the repository itself. For instance, TARP noted specific unmet demands for kidney, head and neck, brain, and pediatric tissue. The more specialized repository at Duke University Breast SPORE rarely received requests that it was unable to fill. Re- searchers are attempting to work around the problem of decreasing tissue availability by developing new research techniques. For in- stance, a surgeon at Duke University has developed a new procedure to extract tissue from small lumpectomies because these specimens leave significantly less breast tissue available for banking. Further technical advances will be needed to collect tissue in quantities that meet the needs of researchers.
AFIP, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI all noted the lack of specific technological capabilities or specimen types as their major unmet user needs. At AFIP, the vast majority of the specimens are embedded in paraffin or mounted on slides and there-
fore not usable for studies requiring fresh or fresh-frozen tissue. Uni- versity of Pittsburgh HSTB reports that there has been an unmet de- mand for biological fluid samples and envisions a need to develop a system to track follow-up blood work done on individuals who have donated tissue to the repository. Ardais noted an increasing demand from its customers for more specialized processing and testing of tis- sue samples before distribution, and more requests for new types of tissue not yet stored in the repository (e.g., aqueous tumor samples, cartilage, and post-mortem specimens). At GCI there is a demand for a serum biomarker platform.
Some of the repositories provide samples to researchers primarily for basic research (e.g., CHTN and TARP), other repositories provide samples primarily for familial studies (e.g., Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry) or epidemiological research (e.g., NHLBI), and still others provide samples primarily for translational research (e.g., all of the SPOREs and University of Pittsburgh HSTB) or drug discovery (e.g., Ardais and GCI). All of the repositories have supplied tissue to researchers conducting DNA, RNA, and protein-based ex- periments. They also all report subsets of the following: fluorescent in situ hybridization, tissue microarrays, immunohistochemistry, gene mapping, pharmacogenomics, cancer biomarker studies, translational research, cell model development, and epidemiological studies. Sam- ples from several of the repositories, including CHTN, TARP, EDRN, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, Duke Univer- sity Breast SPORE, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, and University of Pittsburgh HSTB, are pri- marily used for cancer research.
Most repositories have in place methods to measure or track how re- searchers are using their resources. CHTN closely monitors researcher service through its extensive database, often on a daily basis, which allows close integration of supply and demand, and prepares annual reports about the use of the repository. CHTN also evaluates its re- source using metrics approved by the NCI Executive Committee, in- cluding tracking the number of publications based on research using the tissue resource, devising impact measures, and analyzing the types of research being conducted using the resource. Multiple subcommit- tees are responsible for evaluating the resource, including the Mar- keting, Development, and Operations Subcommittee, the Strategic Planning Subcommittee, and the Quality Assurance Subcommittee. CHTN and the Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry both send postcards with every shipment to solicit feedback on the quality of the samples, the associated data, and shipping. CHTN also sends questionnaires to researchers annually that, in addition to asking questions regarding the quality of samples received, solicits input on current usage and future needs to allow the resource to evolve. Ardais and GCI also solicit feedback directly from researchers, and recipients of GCI samples are encouraged to return for GCI review any samples that fail. Ardais also has such a “return” policy. The effectiveness of the TARP resource is also evaluated through consumer input and di- rect contact with users. TARP also evaluates itself through compari- sons to other commercial vendors providing tissue microarrays. So- licitation of direct researcher feedback on specific samples received allows for more targeted identification of specific problems or incon- sistencies among the specimens in the repository and is a best prac- tice.
EDRN has taken a slightly different approach. It formed a net- work consulting committee to assist in the continual re-evaluation of its network’s overall concept, mission, and design. The committee monitors the growth of the network and functions as a liaison be- tween EDRN and the greater cancer community. Similarly, Univer- sity of Pittsburgh HSTB uses tissue bank utilization committees (“or- gan specific”) to measure its usefulness through direct feedback from
surgeons, oncologists, pathologists, and researchers. Although not formally a committee, the Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE holds monthly meetings with scientists on both the tissue collection and the consumer side to discuss issues related to repository tissues. Ardais relies on internal customer service and medical center alliance groups to ensure that researcher feedback is incorporated into collection pro- tocols. In addition, Ardais rigorously analyzes the collection versus distribution metrics of the repository against diagnosis, sample type, tissue type, format, and other characteristics. Evaluation of repository usefulness through committees or review groups in which both pro- viders and users are able to provide input is a best practice.
CHTN, TARP, Ardais, and GCI actively adapt to researcher needs in a variety of ways to make sure they are collecting the types of tissue needed. These repositories regularly assess the needs of re- searchers and track the numbers and types of tissue samples distrib- uted. This information is then used to quickly change collection pri- orities to match customer demand. Assessing the needs of researchers, tracking the numbers and types of tissue samples distributed, and using this information to quickly change collection priorities to match customer demand are best practices.
Give priority to researchers at collecting institutions to increase support for the resource and investment in the quality of the specimens collected. All of the SPOREs evaluated and Ardais and GCI reward the efforts of their collecting institutions and offer them at least a slight priority when distributing samples.
Use a tissue utilization committee to prioritize tissue distribution based on merit review of all research proposals using standardized criteria to ensure equitable distribution of tissue to as broad a base of researchers as possible. Committees are usually made up of phy- sicians, administrators, and researchers. EDRN, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, AFIP, Mayo Clinic Prostate
Implement a policy to control the distribution of the last sample of a particular specimen and prevent the monopolization of an en- tire specimen or type of specimen by one researcher. Such policies help to ensure that samples are available to a larger group of re- searchers. NHLBI uses a “last file policy” to control the distribu- tion of the last sample of a particular specimen and to alert study personnel of potential depletions in specimen collections. Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE and Ardais have implemented policies to prevent the control of an entire specimen or type of specimen by one researcher. CHTN has policies to ensure that samples are available to the largest number of researchers, as well.
Solicit feedback from researchers on the samples they receive to identify specific problems, inconsistencies, or shortcomings of specimens in the repository or specimens being collected in a cer- tain way or from a certain collection site. CHTN and Philadel- phia Familial Breast Cancer Registry both send postcards with sample shipments to researchers to ask for such feedback. TARP, Ardais, and GCI all have policies in place to solicit and integrate direct feedback from researchers.
Use committees or review groups composed of both providers and consumers to provide input on the usefulness of the repository re- sources and evaluate how well the repository is meeting user needs. EDRN, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, and Ardais all have formed and use such groups.
Assess the needs of researchers, track the numbers and types of tissue samples distributed, and use this information to quickly change collection priorities to match customer demand. CHTN, TARP, Ardais, and GCI actively adapt to researcher needs to make sure they are collecting the types of tissue needed.
RAND evaluated twelve repositories, which were grouped into three general sectors: government, academia, and industry (see Chapter Two, Table 2.1). The first category, government, includes two reposi- tories funded by and operated by federal agencies, one repository con- tracted by a federal agency, and three repositories funded through cooperative agreements with a federal agency. The second category, academia, includes repositories at three major academic medical cen- ters that are funded through Specialized Center Grants (P50s) from NCI, and one repository at a major academic medical center that houses both NCI-funded resources and institute-funded programs. The third category, industry, includes two private companies that op- erate biospecimen repositories. Different business models are repre- sented within each category, including tissue banking versus prospec- tive collection and distribution, networks versus individual sites, and centralized versus decentralized collection, storage, and bioinformat- ics systems.
Six of the repositories evaluated for this study were categorized as government repositories. TARP and AFIP are government-sponsored and government-operated resources. CHTN, EDRN, and Phila- delphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry are funded through Coopera- tive Agreements with NCI. NHLBI contracted out the operation of
its Biological Specimen Repository to BBI-Biotech Research Labora- tories, a private company. CHTN and EDRN have a small core staff of government employees who facilitate coordination within the re- spective networks.
Of the government repositories evaluated, all but one were es- tablished primarily for the purpose of research. AFIP is foremost a diagnostic referral center and secondarily a tissue bank. AFIP does not seek out specimens for collection and banking; it is sent speci- mens, unsolicited, from pathologists for diagnostic purposes. AFIP serves as a referral center for pathologists in need of a secondary ex- pert opinion. After AFIP renders a diagnosis, the specimen is stored in its repository (some specimens are returned to the submitting insti- tution upon request). Although its primary function is in the area of diagnosis, AFIP pathologists do conduct some epidemiological re- search, particularly in clinical pathological correlations.
The academic repositories included in this evaluation were all par- tially government sponsored, usually with funding through a variety of granting mechanisms. All of the academic repositories operate one or more of the SPOREs. In addition to its Breast SPORE, Duke University has a Brain SPORE. Mayo Clinic has a Prostate SPORE, and also collects breast, ovary, intestine, pancreas, heart, brain, skin, bone, kidney, and bladder tissue. In addition to its Breast and Ovar- ian SPOREs, UAB has a Brain SPORE and a new Pancreas SPORE, is one of the Biomarker Validation Laboratories for EDRN, and serves as the Southern Division of CHTN. UPMC has a Lung SPORE and is also participating in CPCTR and EDRN.
The SPOREs are funded through Specialized Center Grants (P50s) from NCI. University of Pittsburgh HSTB receives most of its funding from NIH, NCI, the Department of Defense, and the State of Pennsylvania. In addition, small amounts of funding are provided by sponsored corporate relationships. A small part of the funding for
the biospecimen repositories at Duke University and the Mayo Clinic also comes from private sources.
RAND evaluated two industry repositories, Ardais and GCI. Ardais operates as a tissue bank and distribution service. GCI has a dual business model. It operates a fee-for-service tissue bank and distribu- tion center that works primarily with the pharmaceutical industry to collect specimens for drug development, and it also participates in collaborative research with pharmaceutical and biotech companies and academic and government institutions. Collaborations with aca- demic medical centers and government institutions are done on a non-profit basis. GCI and Ardais are privately funded, although Ardais has some public grant money for research projects.
How repositories arrange for the collection of specimens varies de- pending upon the business model. All of the academic repositories collect specimens almost exclusively from their on-site and associated medical facilities; hence, no formal agreements are necessary. The Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE has gone outside of its hospital system to obtain specimens on rare occasions if there is a specific need that cannot be met otherwise.
The remainder of repositories tend to draw from a mix of com- munity hospitals and academic medical centers for the bulk of their collection. Many of the regional divisions of CHTN have agreements with several community hospitals to enable them to provide research- ers with a broad range of samples. For example, the Eastern Division has agreements with several sites to collect specimens, including six community hospitals, two eye banks, and an organ procurement or- ganization. The collection model at Ardais has been designed to be flexible in size, scalable, and deployable at multiple sites. Ardais cur-
rently has arrangements with three academic medical centers (Duke University, Beth Israel, University of Chicago) and one hospital (Maine Medical Center) that serve as collection sites. GCI has over 700 collection sites in the United States, and has collected specimens from sites in Belgium, Poland, Tunisia, Vietnam, and India. GCI has made arrangements at the institutional level as well as with individual doctors through its Physician Network™.
The contractual agreements between collection sites and reposi- tories are negotiated on a case-by-case basis. One repository may have different agreements with different collection sites. CHTN has nego- tiated agreements with some collection sites that provide some fund- ing up front and then reimbursement for certain services or mile- stones. It also has fee-for-service agreements with some of its sites. GCI reimburses collection sites on a cost basis.
CHTN, EDRN, the Breast and Ovarian CFRs, and NHLBI all have a coordinating body that oversees the general operations of the reposi- tories and sets procedures and policies. GCI and Ardais have scientific advisory boards. A CHTN coordinating committee consisting of an NCI representative plus two representatives from each CHTN divi- sion sets the general operating procedures and policies for the net- work. Procedures are designed to enhance throughput rather than storage, since the CHTN was not designed for banking. A quality assurance subcommittee sets general standards for the pathology pro- cedures and has developed a procedure manual that is used at all CHTN sites. Issues of quality control are discussed on a continuing basis, and criteria are modified as necessary. In addition, CHTN con- tinually assesses researcher needs for services such as laser capture micro-dissection (LCMD) and tissue microarrays and adds new serv- ices when sufficient demand exists. CHTN has other subcommittees, including a marketing, development, and operations subcommittee, a quality assurance subcommittee, and a strategic planning subcom- mittee.
EDRN has a steering committee that coordinates the work of the consortium and provides major scientific management oversight. It is made up of the network’s principal investigators and NCI staff and is responsible for developing and implementing protocols, de- signs, and operations.
The Breast and Ovarian CFRs, of which Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry is a member, has a steering committee, which is its official governing body. The steering committee is responsible for developing the core protocols for biospecimen collection, the core instruments for the collection of epidemiological and clinical data, and policy and procedures. The Breast and Ovarian CFRs also has an advisory board, which is an independent, multidisciplinary panel of senior cancer researchers that evaluates requests from researchers for use of the CFRs’ resources. The advisory committee makes recom- mendations on research priorities to the steering committee, which ratifies the recommendations, based on the feasibility of providing the requested resources. The Breast and Ovarian CFRs also has a publica- tions working group that oversees all issues associated with publica- tions.
NHLBI has a DCC. The DCC for the LAM Registry performs its daily operations based on direction provided by its steering com- mittee, data and safety monitoring board, and the NHLBI program office. In addition, a tissue repository committee provides direction to the DCC in regard to biological specimen distribution.
Many of those interviewed indicated that when discussions with a medical facility about becoming a participating collection site first begin, it is most productive to talk to pathologists and surgeons rather than administrators. That is, it is important to have “buy-in” up front from the people who will be directly working with the re- pository. It is also important to have someone involved from the be- ginning that understands every aspect of the process. Ultimately, it is necessary to establish good working relationships with all levels of collection site staff.
CHTN Eastern Division suggested caution when setting up collections from institutions that are already collecting tissue for other repositories—not only because of competition for specimens, but to minimize redundancy resulting from a specimen from one tissue source being divided up between different repositories. Researchers may unknowingly receive redundant samples if they have submitted requests to multiple repositories.
BBI, which operates the NHLBI repository, suggested that it is important for the repository to be involved in the design phase of a research effort. Storage experts can help determine the best proce- dures to use and can be helpful in identifying correct equipment, proper shipping techniques, and labeling.
Good communication between the repository and collection site was also considered vital. At CHTN Eastern Division, collection site personnel function as an extension of CHTN staff and are integrated into repository processes. There are contractual requirements for monitoring, reporting, and interaction, and there is often daily con- tact between CHTN and collection site staff. Ardais staff are in con- tinuous contact with collection site staff, and formal meetings are held on a regular basis. GCI has one full-time staff member whose sole responsibility is to communicate with collection sites. Establish- ing and maintaining close working relationships with surgeons, pathologists, nurses, and other relevant staff at the collection sites is a best practice.
Most of the repositories evaluated did both prospective collecting of specimens and banking of specimens. Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, NHLBI, AFIP, and the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs are only involved in banking. Both of the industry reposito- ries, Ardais and GCI, are primarily involved in banking but have done some prospective collecting. CHTN primarily conducts pro-
spective collection and distribution of biospecimens and does limited banking. This prospective procurement model enables CHTN to closely tailor specimen preparation to individual researcher requests and needs. Combining banking to collect and maintain a ready sup- ply of tissue with prospective collection to meet researcher needs is a best practice.
CHTN, EDRN, the Breast and Ovarian CFRs (of which the Phila- delphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry is a member), and University of Pittsburgh HSTB are decentralized resources deployed through a distributed physical network of geographically dispersed tissue centers that are coordinated and supported by a centralized bioinformatics and data management system networked across the country (see Fig- ure 6.1, A). Their specimens are stored at geographically dispersed sites. CHTN has six regional divisions, located at academic medical centers that collect specimens at those centers and from satellite sites that include community hospitals, eye banks, and organ procurement organizations. Specimens are stored for short periods of time (usually four to six weeks) at each regional site until they are distributed to researchers. The data and information regarding these specimens are maintained in a centrally located bioinformatics and data manage- ment system that is accessible by members of the repository network. Each collection/storage site also maintains its own bioinformatics and data management system that links to the centralized system. The bioinformatics systems for CHTN, EDRN, and University of Pitts- burgh HSTB are only accessible by repository personnel. Members of the Breast and Ovarian CRFs can upload data to the bioinformatics system, but only staff at the Informatics Center at the University of California, Irvine, have access to download information.
NHLBI, AFIP, Ardais, and GCI have a decentralized collection model but maintain their storage and distribution of specimens and their bioinformatics system at one physical location (Figure 6.1, B).

TARP also has a decentralized collection model with the bioinfor- matics system and storage maintained at one physical location, but it sends its tissue microarrays to CHTN Eastern Division for distribu- tion to users. Duke University Breast SPORE, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, and the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs have centralized collection, storage, and bioinformatics systems and data management (Figure 6.1, C). These centralized bioinformatics systems have vari- ous levels of access. For example, Ardais’s system is directly accessible by its customers, but the bioinformatics systems at all of the SPOREs and at GCI are accessible by repository personnel only.
Most of those interviewed did not know the cost per sample for their repository to collect, process, store, and distribute tissue. CHTN es- timates that it costs approximately $60 per sample shipped. This in- cludes costs involved in collecting, processing, storing, and distribut- ing each specimen. TARP also estimates that it costs $60 to produce and distribute each slide from a tissue microarray. The UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs estimate that it costs between $120 and $150 for tissue and data collection per patient, and has an annual operating budget of $80,000 to $100,000 to cover tissue collection and research services. The annual budget for the repository at AFIP is $3.2 mil- lion. Likewise, University of Pittsburgh HSTB estimates that it cur- rently receives $2 to $3 million annually either directly or indirectly through grants, sponsored research agreements, and founda- tion/institutional support for its tissue bank and related informatics program. Ardais collects detailed activity-based costing information for all cases and samples accrued but declined to share that informa- tion publicly. GCI also declined to share this information. In many cases, the cost of running the repository was not well known, because the costs are split among multiple grants covering different portions of various personnel’s salaries.
CHTN charges academic researchers $20 per sample and charges commercial researchers $60 per sample for the initial processing of the tissue (e.g., snap frozen, paraffin embedded). CHTN uses item- ized pricing based on the level of work involved, adding a surcharge for tissue processing in addition to the initial processing (e.g., an H&amp;E slide costs an additional $7, an unstained slide costs an addi- tional $5, and a touch preparation costs an additional $4.50). CHTN is attempting to recover its tissue processing costs. TARP, also mov- ing toward cost recovery, charges academic researchers $40 per slide (TARP first must buy its specimens from CHTN for $20, and then CHTN charges $20 per array for distribution). TARP charges com- mercial researchers $120 per slide. Tissue microarrays produced by commercial businesses can cost $150 to $200 per slide for 80 to 100 cancer samples, whereas TARP arrays contain smaller cores and a much higher density of tissue samples (300 to 500 cancers).
Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry charges $1 per mi- crogram of DNA. AFIP attempts to recover some of the processing charges. For example, it charges $2.50 per H&amp;E slide. Other types of tissue processing at AFIP can be as much as $200 a slide depending upon the complexity of the request.
University of Pittsburgh HSTB provides researchers at the uni- versity with a small amount of tissue for pilot projects with the un- derstanding that grant proposals will include money in the budget for the repository. There are currently approximately ten to fifteen grants that support the repository’s activities. CPCTR, of which Pittsburgh is one of four participating locations, has a set fee structure: $40 per set of samples (four standard 5-micron or two 10-micron slides), $50 for RNA or DNA analysis, and $100 for a frozen tissue specimen not to exceed 0.2 gram. Additional slides cost $3 for a standard 5-micron slide; $4 for 3- to 4-micron slides; $5 for 10-micron slides;
$10 for an 11- to 24-micron thick section on a slide; $20 for a 25-micron or thicker section (placed in a tube for polymerase chain reaction [PCR] analysis); and $4 for a slide with an H&amp;E stained sec- tion. All charges are tripled for commercial researchers requesting material.
EDRN, NHLBI, and Duke University Breast SPORE provide samples free of charge. Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE samples are free, although there is a nominal cutting fee if the researcher wants the laboratory to make sections. Samples from the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs are free to members of the SPORE at UAB and are
GCI negotiates the price per slide under each contract, although standard fees apply. The company declined to give its exact pricing schedule. On research collaborations with academic or government scientists, samples are provided at or near cost or sometimes for free. Ardais declined to publicly disclose pricing but does provide its part- ner medical center researchers with samples at cost or less.
Although not often practiced, accurate determination of the ac- tual costs of collecting, processing, storing, and distributing tissue samples combined with operating on a cost recovery basis (at least for the government and non-profit organizations) to financially sustain the repository is a best practice.
All the repositories evaluated claimed to constantly watch for new technologies to improve their processes. Some have regular meetings with staff to brainstorm the issue; others have more formal mecha- nisms, such as committees or workshops established to purposefully scan for improvements and new technologies.
Some of the repositories are actually involved in creating new technologies and techniques. TARP, for example, develops and pro- motes new tissue fixation and processing techniques. Duke University Breast SPORE developed a new surgical protocol to collect breast tis- sue because of increased difficulty obtaining sizable amounts of tissue given more focused breast surgeries. It developed a method of ex- tracting a core from limited resection (e.g., lumpectomy) specimens without affecting the diagnostic ability of surgical pathologists.
University of Pittsburgh HSTB is developing technologies to improve the lifetime of specimens in storage. It has also developed a whole-slide imaging system that takes digital images of whole slides, compresses the files (10:1), and shares them over the Internet, allow- ing pathologists to evaluate samples without actually having the slide or microscope in front of them. Ardais developed new tissue handling and extraction methods that it supplies to the collection sites.
Continually assessing new technologies and creating a process flexible enough to develop and incorporate added-value technologies into the repository is a best practice.
All repositories request acknowledgment if their resource is used in research, although few have actual requirements or any form of en- forcement. At the academic-based and commercial repositories, no acknowledgment is required, although someone from the repository often is listed as a co-author on the publication. Other forms of ac- knowledgment include mention in the methods section of the publi- cation or in the acknowledgments section at the end of the publica- tion. Most of the government repositories (CHTN, TARP, EDRN, the Cancer Family Registries, and AFIP) have stricter rules on ac- knowledgement. In each case, researchers must agree to the acknowl- edgment in order to receive specimens, and specific wording is sug- gested. For example, CHTN requires researchers to sign an Agreement for Use of Tissue to obtain samples, and part of that agreement suggests that a specifically worded acknowledgment be used in any resulting publication. EDRN requires acknowledgment and strictly checks for it when collaborators are up for review. AFIP provides a standard disclosure statement, which is detailed in AFIP
Requiring specific acknowledgment of the repository and pro- viding researchers with the specific language to use in publications is a best practice because it raises the visibility of the resource and may encourage future participation in and use of the resource.
Establish and maintain close working relationships with surgeons, pathologists, nurses, and other relevant staff at the collection sites. CHTN, Ardais, and GCI make concerted efforts to establish and maintain close working relationships with collection site staff.
Combine banking to collect and maintain a ready supply of tissue with prospective collection to meet researcher needs. CHTN, Duke University Breast SPORE, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, and University of Pittsburgh HSTB are engaged in a combination of banking and prospective collection.
Accurately determine the actual costs of collecting, processing, storing, and distributing tissue samples to researchers, and operate on a cost recovery basis to financially sustain the repository. CHTN, TARP, AFIP, UAB, and University of Pittsburgh HSTB provided information about costs.
Continually assess new technologies and take measures to develop and incorporate new technologies into the repository. All the re- positories evaluated are constantly evaluating new technologies to improve their processes.
Require acknowledgment of the repository and provide research- ers specific language to use in publications to raise the visibility of the resource and encourage future participation in and use of the resource. Acknowledgment is required and specific wording is suggested by CHTN, TARP, EDRN, the CFRs, and AFIP. The remainder of the repositories request acknowledgment if their re- source was used but do not require it.
A major concern with the storage and distribution of biospecimens is protecting the privacy of individuals who contribute specimens to the repository and maintaining the confidentiality of the associated data. Another issue is ensuring that these individuals are treated ethically. There are several layers of oversight of research involving human par- ticipants, including federal regulations governing research with hu- man participants (the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (45 C.F.R. §46; the Common Rule); and the FDA Protec- tion of Human Subjects Regulations (Title 21 C.F.R. Part 50 and Part 56)), state legislation governing the privacy of and research use of medical records, and the HIPAA Standards for Privacy of Indi- vidually Identifiable Health Information (Privacy Rule) protecting individually identifiable health information and limiting the ways in which the information can be used. IRB review and informed consent provide additional protections to research participants.
All of the repositories evaluated place great importance on pro- tecting privacy, maintaining confidentiality, and ensuring the ethical treatment of tissue sources. How they deal with these issues varies among repositories and is discussed in this chapter.
tributed along with the biospecimens. The character of the personal information associated with biospecimens as they exist in repositories and in the hands of researchers is based on the schema developed by the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC, 1999). NBAC determined that biospecimens at repositories are of two types: identi- fied and unidentified. An identified specimen is one that is linked to personal information in such a way that the person from whom the material was obtained could be identified by name, patient number, or clear family relationship. An unidentified specimen is one for which identifiable information was not collected or, if collected, was not maintained and cannot be retrieved by the repository. When the samples are distributed, they may be identified, coded, unlinked, or unidentified. Samples that are coded are supplied by repositories to researchers from identified tissues with a code rather than with any personally identifying information. The researchers do not have ac- cess to identifying information, but the sample code can be linked back to the patient by the person or organization that holds the key to the code (e.g., repository personnel, cancer registrar, or honest broker1). Finally, unlinked samples (sometimes called anonymized) lack any code or identifying information that could be traced back to the original specimen source.
The HIPAA Privacy Rule defines de-identified health informa- tion as “health information that does not identify an individual and with respect to which there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual is not individually identifiable health information” (45 C.F.R. § 164.514(a)-(c)). Pro- tected health information can be de-identified by using either this privacy rule’s safe harbor method for de-identification or statistical verification of de-identification. Under the safe harbor method, 18
An honest broker is a neutral intermediary between the individual whose tissue and data are being studied and the researcher. The honest broker collects and collates pertinent infor- mation regarding the tissue source, replaces identifiers with a code, and releases only coded information to researchers. (See the discussion below, in the subsection entitled Protection of Privacy and Confidentiality, for more discussion on the use of honest brokers.)
identifiers2 that could be used to identify the individual or the indi- vidual’s relatives, employers, or household members are removed from each record, and the remaining information cannot be used, alone or in combination with other information, to identify the indi- vidual. Using NBAC’s schema, coded and unlinked samples would be distributed to researchers with de-identified protected health informa- tion. Another approach is to use a “limited data set” with a data use agreement. A limited data set allows repositories to provide dates and limited geographic information, but most of the HIPAA identifiers are still removed.
All repositories evaluated for this study collect some, if not all, specimens with identifying information (see Table 7.1). In most cases the identifying information is kept in a database that is linked by codes and accessible to very few personnel, and in many cases it never reaches the actual repository where the specimens are eventually stored. GCI is an exception in that the link between the tissue speci- mens collected and the tissue sources’ identities is permanently de- stroyed after 30 days by a third-party contractor.
Ardais, like GCI, does not receive identifying information with the specimens it receives from the collection sites; therefore, the specimens are stored as unidentified. In both cases identifying infor- mation is collected from the tissue sources, but the link between the tissue sources and the information never reaches the repository. For all blood/sera collected for GCI, the document linking the tissue source’s identity with the specimen code is sent to a third-party con- tractor after the 30-day period. Similar to GCI’s treatment of blood/sera, Ardais keeps all information linking the tissue source’s identity to the specimen at the collecting institutions.
BBI, which stores specimens for NHLBI, also does not receive identifying information or any link between identifying information and the specimen regardless of whether this information was initially
The identifiers that must be removed include direct identifiers, such as name, social secu- rity number, medical record number, health plan beneficiary number, street address, tele- phone/fax number, e-mail address, vehicle license plate number, as well as other identifiers, such as birth date, admission and discharge dates, date of death, and five-digit zip code.
Identifiability of Specimens in Repository
Unlinked/coded at the repository after collection
Unlinked/coded automatically by bioinformatics system when data are extracted from records
collected. NHLBI has a tissue repository committee that oversees the security of patient data. TARP does not receive any identifying in- formation with the tissue samples it gets from CHTN; however, some of the samples it receives from collaborators may be identified.
CHTN, EDRN, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, AFIP, the SPOREs, and University of Pittsburgh HSTB all store identified tissue specimens. Identifying information is kept with the specimens at AFIP and EDRN, although this information is not available in the database. CHTN Eastern Division receives identified specimens collected at the University of Pennsylvania Health System, but specimens from other satellite sites are sent to CHTN unidenti- fied. This is also true of other CHTN divisions. Identifying informa- tion is kept in the database at Duke University Breast SPORE, but access to this information is limited to two people. At Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, all specimens are stripped of identifying informa- tion and given a unique ID number. Identifying information on each tissue source can still be linked to the specimens if the appropriate consent is obtained. At University of Pittsburgh HSTB, specimens are identified, but only a few repository personnel, trained as honest brokers, have access to the identifying information.
All repositories except TARP and Duke University Breast SPORE distribute coded samples (see Table 7.1). CHTN mostly dis- tributes coded samples, except for those that come from satellite col- lection sites and from Vanderbilt, which are unlinked. All informa- tion distributed with the samples is de-identified. AFIP distributes coded and unlinked samples, with any links to personally identifying information kept at the repository. AFIP also distributes some identi- fied samples, but only if researchers have the appropriate IRB ap- proval and the need for informed consent has been waived by the IRB. NHLBI noted that if personal information were required by an investigator, the repository (BBI) would not be involved in the proc- ess and the request would instead go solely through its DCC. At GCI, all tissue samples are distributed as unlinked samples (i.e., the link is destroyed after collection), whereas blood, serum, and DNA samples can be distributed as coded samples. In contrast, the TARP
IRBs are responsible for the oversight and review of research that in- volves human participants to ensure that their privacy is protected and confidentiality of data is maintained. In 1997, the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) issued guidance for human biospecimen repositories sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS):
Operation of the Repository and its data management center should be subject to oversight by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB should review and approve a protocol specifying the conditions under which data and specimens may be accepted and shared, and ensuring adequate provisions to protect the pri- vacy of subjects and maintain the confidentiality of data. The IRB should also review and approve a specimen collection pro- tocol and informed consent document for distribution to tissue collectors and their local IRBs. A Certificate of Confidentiality should be obtained to protect confidentiality of repository specimens and data. (OHRP, 1997)
Therefore, the collection, storage, and distribution practices of federally funded repositories, as well as the research for which the in- vestigator is requesting tissue samples, may be subject to IRB review and approval.
All of the repositories evaluated utilized an IRB to oversee the repository practices and to ensure that patient privacy and confidenti- ality are protected, and most of them require researchers requesting samples to have IRB approval for their research (see Table 7.2). At EDRN, each participating institution is responsible for following the EDRN guidelines, which require that every proposal have IRB ap- proval before being allowed to participate/collaborate in the network. EDRN thus does not have its own IRB.
IRB Dedicated/ Contracted to Repository?
Both Ardais and GCI utilize private IRBs for research requests that do not already have IRB approval. Ardais has contracted with Independent Review Consulting (IRC). GCI currently works with two commercial IRBs, Essex IRB and Western IRB, and is always evaluating other commercial IRBs.
BBI has its own IRB. In addition, NHLBI’s DCC also uses its own IRB (the Cleveland Clinic Foundation) and must pass an annual
University of Pittsburgh HSTB, the SPOREs at Duke Univer- sity, the Mayo Clinic, and UAB all use their own IRBs. TARP uses the IRB at NCI, and the Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry uses the IRB at FCCC.
CHTN, EDRN, NHLBI, Ardais, and GCI all require IRB review/approval to accompany researchers’ proposals or requests for samples. University of Pittsburgh HSTB and Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE also require IRB approval. Additionally, Mayo Clnic Prostate SPORE requires non-expedited approval plus a review by the Institu- tion Bio-Specimen Approval Board.
AFIP sends all requests through either its IRB or its tissue utili- zation committee. Duke University Breast SPORE does not require IRB approval from researchers citing that all its samples are un- identified before distribution. TARP also does not require IRB ap- proval, because the tissues used to make the arrays are unlinked (i.e., not linked to any personally identifying information about the tissue source, or anonymized), and therefore use of the arrays is exempt.
Requiring repositories to have IRB approval for the collection, storage, and distribution of biospecimens and associated data, and requiring researchers requesting samples to have IRB review of re- search projects that will use the samples are best practices.
In addition to IRB review and approval, all of the repositories have other guidelines, policies, and procedures in place to protect patient confidentiality. The CFRs Informatics Center, which designed the bioinformatics system, provides guidelines for data standardization and specimen anonymization, and implements network and database security, such as password protection, encryption, and firewalls. In addition, FCCC, where Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry is housed, has a Certificate of Confidentiality.
At BBI, the repository’s own IRB ensures that the study is com- pliant with federal regulations governing research with human par- ticipants (45 C.F.R. §46). Because BBI never has any of the identifi-
able information, no procedures are needed to ensure that the reposi- tory maintains patient confidentiality. In addition, NHLBI’s DCC undergoes its own IRB review annually. Ardais’s situation is similar to BBI’s in that it does not have the identifying information at the ac- tual repository. The consenting and de-identification procedures fol- lowed at the collection sites have been subject to third-party audit and no significant issues have been found.
CHTN in general keeps all identifying information at the vari- ous collection sites it uses. CHTN and University of Pittsburgh HSTB use the “honest broker” model. The honest broker gathers data from multiple sources and replaces identifying information with a code (Merz et al., 1997). The researcher then has access only to the coded information, not to the identifying information. The Honest Broker System at University of Pittsburgh HSTB, which is IRB ap- proved, encompasses the Health Science Tissue Bank, Clinical Out- comes, the Cancer Registry, Centers for Pathology and Oncology In- formatics, and the Center for Pathology Quality and Health Care Research. The Honest Broker System, which is under the systems management officer, provides seamless communication between these departments and allows researchers to obtain tissue samples and asso- ciated data from a single source.
CHTN uses many other strategies to ensure patient confidenti- ality, including IRB oversight, coding, parsing to verify data prior to unlinking, vulnerability assessment, and automated encryption or de- linking. University of Pittsburgh HSTB employs both physical and cyber security measures (e.g., shredders, guards, firewalls, and pass- words) to protect personal patient information. Some of these strate- gies may also be employed by other repositories, but they are all use- ful as specific examples of possible ways to approach these issues.
TARP, which receives many of its samples from CHTN, gener- ally does not keep identifying information with the specimens in the laboratory for the publicly available tissue microarrays. One collabo- rative study that is currently ongoing does use identifiable informa- tion, but it is accessible by only two people. This limited-access strat- egy generally is used in all of the repositories at which identifiable information is kept on site. At Duke University Breast SPORE, only
two people have access to information linking patients to specimens. The database containing this information is otherwise protected by passwords in a locked room.
The UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs keep all personally iden- tifying information in a separate log that is not accessible on line. For identified specimens, GCI uses a third party that has signed a legal contract to keep the information confidential. Limiting access to the codes that link patients’ identifying information to their tissue speci- mens through physical and/or cyber procedures to minimize the chance of identifying information being released is a best practice. This is practiced at CHTN, EDRN, NHLBI, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI.
In addition to IRB oversight, several repositories also rely on separate review boards or committees to oversee their privacy and confidentiality procedures: CHTN, EDRN, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, AFIP, Ardais, and GCI. CHTN has a coor- dinating committee and the Breast and Ovarian CFR has a steering committee to oversee these procedures. At EDRN it is a data sharing and informatics subcommittee that meets to develop security systems and safeguards for protecting patient privacy. GCI has a bioethics ad- visory board, which follows the standards and guidelines set out by the NBAC. Ardais also has a bioethics advisory board. AFIP follows Department of Defense guidelines that incorporate HIPAA and regulate the use of human participants in research. Having a bioethics advisory board or other governance and oversight board/committee to oversee privacy and confidentiality procedures is a best practice that provides another layer of review.
The new HIPAA regulations regarding privacy of individually identi- fiable health information could have significant impact on tissue re- positories. Most of the repositories evaluated have had to modify their procedures to some extent as a result of HIPAA. One exception is AFIP, where the procedures already in place reportedly exceeded HI- PAA requirements, so no further changes were necessary. Research at TARP is exempt under HIPAA because the data are de-identified,
and BBI reported that it has not made any changes yet but is expect- ing some to take place soon—for instance, with regard to the few specimens in the repository that may have patient identifiers on them (note that these were not necessarily specimens from NHLBI- sponsored studies).
Both Ardais and GCI have addressed the new HIPAA require- ments for an authorization form to be given to the institutions serv- ing as collection sites. Both have implemented new procedures for this requirement. Although Ardais mentioned that it is not a covered entity under HIPAA, it has utilized the HIPAA concept of a “data use agreement” and the “limited data set” to address transmissibility of certain types of protected health information. GCI noted that the two types of information it collects that are covered by the new HIPAA regulations (town name and date of procedure) are used by the re- pository for verification purposes only and are not shared with reposi- tory users. Likewise, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs have purged their system of all dates, including dates of medical treatment and birth dates. At Duke University Breast SPORE the practice of reviewing the operating room schedules to identify potential tissue sources was stopped. Now, patients are initially approached by their own physician about donating tissue, and repository personnel then follow up with the patient to get his or her consent. EDRN faced a somewhat unique challenge. A significant portion of the EDRN specimens existed at universities prior to EDRN being established but are now available through the network. Most of the changes that were required in response to HIPAA applied to these earlier collections.
CHTN has begun providing a limited data set to researchers and using data-use agreements that researchers must sign in order to obtain samples. Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry amended its consent form following HIPAA implementation. How- ever, it was noted that these new procedures have not changed the way the research is done.
AFIP, BBI, Duke, TARP, and University of Pittsburgh HSTB all reported that state laws have had no impact on their repositories. Ardais and EDRN have each responded differently to the challenge of having to comply with state laws for collection sites. Ardais has
avoided establishing collection relationships with institutions in the two to three states it has determined have ambiguous laws. EDRN requires every participating collection site to comply with state laws before it joins the network.
Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry reported that New York state law does not allow genetic testing results from a laboratory outside New York State to be given to individuals residing in New York State. The UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs also mentioned that Florida state law requires specific consent from each patient for genetic testing.
A Minnesota state law requiring consent to review a patient’s health records significantly affected Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE. Now all patients must specifically consent to having their medical records used for research.
CHTN overall is not affected by state laws, but each individual collection site must comply with its own state laws. GCI has exam- ined the state laws and believes that in most cases federal law super- cedes them.
Informed consent is a key mechanism for protecting the interests, welfare, and rights of research participants. Informed consent is a process, not just a form, that educates and provides information to potential research participants about details of the research, including potential benefits and risks, procedures, duration, and more, in lan- guage they can understand. The informed consent process enables individuals to decide voluntarily whether or not to participate in research.
AFIP and CHTN primarily collect specimens with a general surgical consent. Specimens submitted to AFIP were originally ob- tained by pathology departments at the hospitals where the patients underwent medical treatment. Therefore, the submitting institution, and not AFIP, determines the actual informed consent process. Most CHTN divisions operate under a waiver of consent, and the speci-
mens are collected with a general surgical consent that indicates that the specimens may be used for research. The operating procedures for each CHTN division have been reviewed by each institution’s IRB to ensure that they meet all of the requirements of current regulations for the protection of research participants. The specific operating procedures, however, vary depending upon the requirements of the IRB at each division and/or collection site, and some CHTN divi- sions obtain specific consent from individuals for the use of their tis- sue. For example, the Pediatric Division of CHTN obtains informed consent for research use of tissue that is collected as part of pediatric clinical trials. Western Division, at Vanderbilt University, provides only unlinked (anonymized) specimens.
At all of the repositories evaluated where specific informed con- sent is obtained for the collection of biospecimens, it is obtained separately from the surgical consent. At Ardais, consent is obtained specifically for the collection of tissue specimens for research pur- poses. This consent is for general research, in the sense that the tissue is being collected without a specific research project in mind. The consent document delineates several protocols supporting research and discovery into diagnostics and therapeutics, and asks for permis- sion to go into the patient’s health records pertaining to the diagnosis for which the surgery was being performed. Since the passage of the Minnesota state law mentioned above, the consent document for Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE also asks for permission to review a pa- tient’s health records. Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE also uses a con- sent template that combines a specific project with a general research area. Obtaining tissue specimens from individuals who are fully in- formed about and have consented to the collection of their tissue by the repository and its use for research purposes is a best practice.3
3 It may not always be possible to obtain full informed consent for the research use of tissue. In its report Research Involving Human Biological Materials: Ethical Issues and Policy Guid- ance, NBAC found that when important research with human biological materials poses little or no risk to participants whose consent would be difficult or impossible to obtain, it is appropriate for the IRB to waive the consent requirement (NBAC, 1999). In addition, cur- rent federal regulations governing research with human participants (45 C.F.R. §46; the Common Rule) state that research with human participants is presumed to require consent,
Ideally, the consent process should occur separately from the surgical consent. However, this is not always possible, so at a minimum, the informed consent for the collection and research use of specimens should be a separate section of the surgical consent form that requires a separate signature.
A few repositories use consent processes that offer individuals who would like to donate tissue some options for limiting the use of their tissue and/or medical information. GCI’s consent is slightly dif- ferent in that individuals who contribute blood are given the option of limiting the use of their specimens solely to research pertaining to the disease for which they were being treated at the time the specimen was collected. This option is not offered for tissue specimens at GCI. At University of Pittsburgh HSTB, the specimens in the repository come with one of three different types of consent: (1) use of the tissue for a specific research project, (2) global consent (not tissue or re- search specific), or (3) non-consented anonymized collection. At UAB, individuals give specific consent for donation of tissue to the Breast or the Ovarian SPORE but can opt out of donating blood and the use of their tissue for genetic research. Likewise, at Duke Univer- sity Breast SPORE, individuals considering donating to the reposi- tory are given the option of consenting to the use of blood products or tissue samples, or both. Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE also uses a tiered consent process that allows individuals to choose what their tissue can be used for. Sometimes, CHTN also uses a tiered consent process. Performing a tiered consent process that allows individuals to choose the type of specimen(s), if any, they want to donate (e.g., tis- sue, blood, or urine), the type of research the specimen can be used for (e.g., a specific research project, general research, or genetic re- search), and/or whether their medical records and outcomes data can be accessed is a best practice.
but that this requirement can be altered or waived by the IRB if all four of the following criteria, set forth at 45 C.F.R. §46.116(d), are met: (1) The research involves no more than minimal risk to participants, (2) the waiver or alteration of consent will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of participants, (3)the research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration, and (4) whenever appropriate, participants will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation.
CHTN, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, NHLBI, Duke University Breast SPORE, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI all use consent interviews. The consent process var- ies among CHTN divisions and even among collection sites, since all consent processes must be approved by each institution’s IRB. Whether EDRN uses a consent interview is determined by the collec- tion site and depends on the study being conducted. Who is respon- sible for consent interviews at each repository and when the consent process is undertaken are detailed in Table 7.3.
Limit access to the codes that link patients’ identifying informa- tion to their tissue specimens through physical and/or cyber pro- cedures to minimize the chance of identifying information being released. This is practiced at all of the repositories.
Require repositories to have IRB approval for the collection, stor- age, and distribution of biospecimens and associated data, and re- quire researchers requesting samples to have IRB review of re- search projects that will use the samples. All of the repositories have IRB oversight of repository practices. All of the repositories except Duke and TARP, which distribute only samples with de- identified data, require researchers requesting samples to have IRB review of their research.
Use a bioethics advisory board or other governance and oversight advisory board to provide another layer of review for privacy and confidentiality procedures. All of the repositories use IRBs to oversee privacy and confidentiality. In addition, CHTN, EDRN, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, AFIP, Ardais, and GCI have some type of advisory board that oversees privacy and confidentiality issues.
Obtain tissue specimens from individuals who are fully informed about and have consented to both the collection of their tissue by the repository and its use for research purposes. Ideally, the con-
sent process should occur separately from the surgical consent. However, this is not always possible, so at a minimum, the in- formed consent for the collection and research use of specimens should be a separate section of the surgical consent form that re- quires a separate signature. EDRN, NHLBI, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, Duke University Breast SPORE, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI primarily collect
Perform a tiered consent process that allows individuals to choose the type of specimen(s), if any, they want to donate (e.g., tissue, blood, or urine), the type of research the specimen can be used for (e.g., a specific research project, general research, or genetic re- search), and/or whether their medical records and outcomes data can be accessed. Duke University Breast SPORE, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, and GCI all use a tiered informed consent process. CHTN also occasionally uses a tiered consent process.
The repositories’ practices and procedures are generally based on the presence of developed standards and policies associated with research involving human participants, and it seems that few problems have been encountered regarding intellectual property or liability. In this chapter, we describe some of the specific mechanisms the institutions have in place to ensure that these policies and procedures are clear and consistent.
The majority of repositories do not retain any intellectual property rights to the samples they distribute, unless they are performing the research in collaboration with other researchers, in which case the in- tellectual property rights are shared. Similarly, institutions that con- tribute specimens to the repository do not retain any intellectual property rights to tissue they submit. For repositories located at aca- demic institutions, much of the tissue collected is used by researchers from that institution, in which case the institution does control in- tellectual property rights. This, however, is based on the researcher’s affiliation with the institution, not the tissue’s affiliation.
The Breast and Ovarian CFRs, of which the Philadelphia Fa- milial Breast Cancer Registry is a member, is the only repository evaluated that specifically maintains intellectual property rights to the data it collects. As stated in the CFRs’ Access Policies and Procedures
Manual: “CFRs sites retain custody of, and have primary rights to, data collected under their current NIH awards, subject to Govern- ment rights of access and consistent with current DHHS, Public Health Service (PHS), and NIH policies” (Cancer Family Registries, 2002).
CHTN takes no ownership position on intellectual property created using its specimens. TARP has determined that its tissue mi- croarrays are not patentable because they are functionally a single- or limited-use reagent with no inherent intellectual property value. AFIP also has no specific policies in place that address intellectual property. It receives tissue under medical consultative conditions and believes that the relinquishment or transfer of tissue from patient to sur- geon/pathologist at the surgical level and from pathologist to AFIP at the secondary consultative level, with no conditions on continued possession, are both irrevocable donations or gifts that transfer owner- ship ultimately to AFIP.
Duke also has no specific intellectual property policies for the distribution of tissue. However, collaborative research with Duke re- searchers becomes Duke University’s intellectual property. Similarly at GCI the fee-for-service researchers retain the intellectual property rights; however, intellectual property rights with GCI collaborators are negotiated on a case-by-case basis. At University of Pittsburgh HSTB, the institution where the research takes place retains the in- tellectual property rights, so the university retains them for research conducted by its researchers, and private-sector companies retain them for research conducted by their researchers. Similarly, Ardais does not retain intellectual property rights for discoveries made using tissue it distributes. Ardais conducted significant legal research to de- velop a licensing mechanism to transfer samples and data from the repository to researchers, ensuring clear ownership of intellectual property developed from sample use.
The tissue microarrays made by TARP are treated as reagents with no inherent intellectual property value. However, tissue microar- rays made using the NCI-60 cell lines or xenografts are protected in- tellectual property and require the use of a materials transfer agree- ment (MTA). Mayo requires MTAs for its tissue, and all sharing is

coordinated through the Mayo Medical Ventures group, a venture capital investing program that tries to find markets for medical re- search conducted at the Mayo Clinic.
As a network of university researchers, EDRN follows the guidelines laid out in the Bayh-Dole law mandating that the intellec- tual property rights for work done by university researchers using government funding and support belong to the researchers. In addi- tion, EDRN requires that any pre-existing agreements that a partici- pant has regarding intellectual property or exclusive licenses must not prevent collaboration within EDRN.
To promote clarity, to prevent potential legal confusion, and to avoid conflicts with tissue sources, researchers using tissue, and insti- tutions contributing biospecimens, it is a best practice to use a spe- cific published policy on intellectual property regarding research use of samples from a repository.
Tissue sources usually have a right to withdraw their consent and have their tissue removed from the repository if the specimens are identifiable. This is a requirement in the Common Rule (45 C.R.F.
§46) for all federally funded research. Individuals donating tissue to CHTN, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, NHLBI, AFIP, Duke University Breast SPORE, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, University of Pitts- burgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI have the right to withdraw consent for the use of their tissue. EDRN’s policies are institution specific. When tissue and data are stripped of identifiers and records are de- stroyed (unlinked samples)—as is the case (1) at GCI once the 30-day window during which a specimen is linked to the tissue source’s iden- tity has expired, and (2) at TARP, which does not receive identifying information with the tissue samples it gets from CHTN—then it is not possible for tissue sources to withdraw their tissue from the repository.
Removing a tissue source’s specimen from the repository also means ensuring that computer records are not maintained for that person. Ardais’s solution to this issue is to perform monthly backups of their computer systems and bioinformatics system. The backup from the previous month is then destroyed, so that when information about a tissue source is removed from the system, the information is not maintained on any backup tapes. Tissue and data that have al- ready been distributed become unlinked (anonymized). In the LAM study at NHLBI, tissue sources also have the right to have their tissue sent to a specific investigator. Other than this, however, at no reposi- tories do tissue sources have the right to request that their tissue be returned to them or that specific studies be performed on their tissue. A best practice in the area of rights to tissue by the tissue source is to allow the withdrawal of consent and have the tissue, data, and com- puter records removed from the repository if the tissue retains identi- fiers to link it to the tissue source and has not already been distrib- uted to researchers.
Institutions similarly give up their rights to the tissue they have contributed to a repository in most cases. However, several reposito- ries, including Ardais and GCI, give the contributing institutions pri- ority for tissue requests. Similarly, at Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, internal researchers have first right to the tissue they provide.1
Generally, tissue sources are not compensated financially, unless the tissue collection is part of a clinical trial that compensates the partici- pants. For specimens collected by CHTN, TARP, Philadelphia Fa- milial Breast Cancer Registry, the NHLBI LAM study, AFIP, Duke University Breast SPORE, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, and Ardais, tissue sources are not compensated in any way. At EDRN, the

policies are institution specific. At GCI, tissue sources are generally not compensated except in a very few cases where they have been reimbursed for time and travel.
In many cases the researchers must sign a formal agreement to obtain tissue. At CHTN, researchers sign the Agreement for Use of Tissue, in which they agree that the samples will be used only for the pur- poses cited in the application, no attempt to obtain identifying in- formation will be made, no specimens will be sold or shared with a third party without the prior written permission of CHTN, they rec- ognize that all specimens should be treated as potentially infectious, they will ensure proper training of all those who will be handling the specimens, there is no implied warranty on the tissue specimens, they are required to acknowledge the use of CHTN specimens in any publications, and they vest liability for any injury involving the use of the specimens to the extent permitted by law with the recipient. CHTN’s Agreement for Use of Tissue was approved by the Office of the General Counsel of DHHS. TARP uses the same agreement. When obtaining samples from Ardais, researchers and entities sign contracts that include license applications, restrictions on use, and data use agreements (i.e., to support HIPAA requirements). EDRN, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, and GCI require recipients to sign material transfer agreements. The use of a tissue use agreement is a best practice. The tissue use agreements should contain language in which researchers agree that the specimens will be used only for the purposes cited in the application, no attempt to obtain identifying information will be made, no specimens will be sold or shared with a third party without the prior written permission of the repository, all specimens will be treated as potentially infectious, all personnel who will be handling the specimens will be properly trained, there is no implied warranty on the specimens, any publications resulting from the use of repository specimens will acknowledge the repository, and the researcher/institution using the tissue assumes responsibility for
all risks associated with the receipt, handling, storage, and use of the tissue.
The NHLBI LAM study does not require researchers to sign an agreement to obtain most samples (i.e., for samples that are unlinked from any identifying information about the tissue source). However, if there are clinical data associated with the sample, an agreement be- tween the researcher and the registry must be signed. NHLBI LAM is planning to use agreements in future studies.
In most cases, liability for the use of tissue lies with the researcher, based on the contract signed to receive the tissue, as described above. None of the repositories has experienced liability issues regarding safety issues associated with the use of the specimens, loss of privacy, or breach of confidentiality of tissue sources, claims by tissue sources of physical/psychosocial harms, or claims by tissue sources to property rights for discoveries made using their tissue. Even so, it is a best practice to specify the responsibility for assuming risks in connection with the use of biospecimens in tissue use agreements, to fully inform tissue sources about risks to their rights and welfare, and to clarify ownership issues during the informed consent process.
In addition to the agreements discussed above, all of the repositories used various means to ensure that tissue is distributed to legitimate researchers and organizations. Inspection of IRB documentation, re- view of the study design for which the samples will be used, verifica- tion that the researcher requesting samples is associated with a legiti- mate research institution, and, in some cases, personal knowledge of researchers in a specific field allow the repositories to be sure that the recipients are legitimate. It is a best practice to carefully review re- searcher credentials and submissions, including IRB documentation,
Use an explicit intellectual property policy to prevent potential legal confusion and contention. Philadelphia Familial Breast Can- cer Registry follows the Cancer Family Registries’ policy on intel- lectual property that is stated explicitly.
Allow tissue sources to withdraw samples if they are not unlinked or have not already been distributed to researchers. This is the policy at CHTN, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, NHLBI (for the LAM study), AFIP, Duke University Breast SPORE, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI (within the 30-day window).
Use a tissue use agreement that contains language in which re- searchers agree that the specimens will be used only for the pur- poses cited in the application, no attempt to obtain identifying in- formation will be made, no specimens will be sold or shared with a third party without the prior written permission of the reposi- tory, all specimens will be treated as potentially infectious, all per- sonnel who will be handling the specimens will be properly trained, there is no implied warranty on the specimens, any publi- cations resulting from the use of repository specimens will ac- knowledge the repository, and the researcher/institution using the tissue assumes responsibility for all risks associated with the re- ceipt, handling, storage, and use of the tissue. The Tissue Use Agreement used by CHTN is a good example of this.
Explicitly specify the responsibility for assuming risks in connec- tion with the use of biospecimens in tissue use agreements, fully inform tissue sources about risks to their rights and welfare, and clarify ownership issues during the informed consent process. CHTN, TARP, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, and Ardais spec-
Perform a careful review of researcher requests, as is conducted by all of the repositories evaluated, to determine researcher creden- tials and to ensure responsible use of samples. This review should include the inspection of IRB documentation, review of the study design for which the samples will be used, and verification that the researcher requesting samples is associated with a legitimate re- search institution.
Public relations, marketing, and education are critical to the success of large tissue repositories and repositories for rare conditions. The repositories evaluated use a combination of approaches to increase the visibility of their resource and mission.
The repositories use a variety of means to market themselves to re- searchers, including advertisements in major journals (e.g., Science and Nature), exhibits at appropriate professional conferences, direct mailings, word of mouth, and Web sites for the repositories and asso- ciated clinical trials and research projects. Some of the smaller reposi- tories do not market themselves at all. CHTN uses exhibits at scien- tific meetings and mailings to researchers attending the meetings, fliers, the NIH Research Festival, journal advertisements, its Web site, and a newsletter to researchers called “Tissue Topics” to market its resource. EDRN also sponsors exhibits at many major scientific conferences that are related to its mission. In addition, EDRN has advertised in JAMA and Science, mostly during its first year. Ardais and GCI also use several of these approaches, including exhibits at meetings, advertising in journals, and word of mouth. In addition, Ardais sponsors a seminar series on clinical genomics. The NHLBI LAM study has effectively used word of mouth, and the LAM Foun- dation usually has an exhibit at various medical conferences. In addi-
tion to advertising the resource at national meetings, AFIP produces a newsletter six times a year that has a broad distribution to 17,000 pa- thologists, 5,000 of whom are outside the United States. AFIP also produces both an annual report and an annual research progress re- port. AFIP is currently developing a new business and marketing plan. Duke and Mayo do not directly market their resources, instead relying on word of mouth. While University of Pittsburgh HSTB has been a part of marketing efforts by CPCTR (at an exhibit at the American Association for Cancer Research [AACR] meeting), most of its exposure is by word of mouth. Using a combination of the meth- ods discussed above—such as exhibits at scientific meetings, word of mouth, Web sites, newsletters, and advertising in scientific jour- nals—to market the repository’s resources represents a best practice.
Few repositories have any marketing strategies for recruiting pa- tients. University of Pittsburgh HSTB has benefited from word of mouth at prostate cancer support groups. FCCC, where Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry is located, has brochures about its Biosample Repository in its patient waiting room. GCI has informa- tion for individuals interested in contributing tissue to the repository on its Web site.
Few of the repositories have active education for and communication with individuals who have donated tissue. EDRN invites patient ad- vocates to all of its workshops, but any communication with tissue sources is institution specific. This is also true for the NHLBI LAM study. The LAM Foundation sponsors scientific and patient work- shops, which report back generalized findings that result from the studies, but communication with tissue sources is specific to the individual clinical centers. Similarly, University of Pittsburgh HSTB does not target specific patients, instead disseminating research news and patient education information on its general Web site (www.upmccancercenters.com), including cancer information and
current clinical trials. University of Pittsburgh HSTB has also dis- seminated research results on the Reuters news wire. The Mayo Clinic has a Web site (http://www.mayoclinic.com) that contains in- formation for cancer patients. GCI sponsors continuing medical edu- cation workshops for all physicians in GCI’s Physician Network. Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry sends a quarterly news- letter to registry participants that summarizes research with registry resources and announces new research projects. Although not widely done today, a best practice for repositories is to provide information about generalized findings that result from research with repository resources to tissue sources and physicians through the Internet, newsletters, and sessions at scientific meetings, or through other out- reach venues.
In some cases, if repository personnel make a diagnosis of a specimen that differs from the one in the pathology report, the re- pository notifies the pathologist on record and/or the attending phy- sician to ensure that patient care is optimal. Both Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry and the Mayo Clinic also state in their informed consent that physicians might contact tissue sources if a genetic study shows something that might be clinically relevant.
Use a combination of methods—such as exhibits at scientific meetings, word of mouth, Web sites, newsletters, and advertising in scientific journals—to market the repository’s resources. CHTN, EDRN, NHLBI, AFIP, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI use all of these methods.
Provide information about generalized findings that result from research with repository resources to tissue sources and physicians through the Internet, newsletters, sessions at scientific meetings, or through other outreach venues. NHLBI LAM Registry, Mayo Clinic, University of Pittsburgh HSTB, Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry, and GCI provide generalized information to tissue sources and/or physicians.
Each of the repositories evaluated for this study was established to fulfill specific needs, and its procedures and operations were designed to enable it to do so. Thus, each repository’s design is integrally linked to the needs it was established to fulfill. Table 10.1 summa- rizes the findings presented in Chapters Three through Nine for each of the repositories evaluated for this study. The design and operation of each repository and other relevant findings are detailed in the first half of this chapter.
CHTN is an NCI-funded repository that prospectively collects and distributes over 60,000 tissue samples per year to academic, govern- ment, and industry researchers. Approximately 80 percent of the tis- sue collected by CHTN is distributed to academic and government researchers. The bioinformatics system used by CHTN was designed as a repository management tool to track specimen collection, charac- terization (histopathology), and distribution. The majority of tissue collected by CHTN is from patients who are undergoing surgical or other diagnostic procedures and have given general surgical consent for the use of their tissue for research and education purposes. Most CHTN divisions operate under a waiver of consent; however, the specific procedures vary depending on the requirements of the IRB at each division and/or collection site. CHTN takes no position on

intellectual property. Researchers sign the Agreement for Use of Tis- sue to use the CHTN resources and accept liability for the use of the resources in this agreement. CHTN actively markets its resource but has no communication with or educational activities for patients from whom biospecimens are collected. Other findings of interest at CHTN are:
CHTN efficiently and effectively prospectively collects and dis- tributes approximately 60,000 samples per year to hundreds of researchers across the United States and Canada. This is by far the greatest number of samples distributed by the twelve reposi- tories evaluated. In addition, CHTN uses standard protocols for the collection, processing, annotation, storage, and distribution of specimens, which are quasi-customized to meet a host of re- searcher needs. The decentralized collection, storage, and distri- bution model, with the regional divisions responsible for their own regions but also networked to help satisfy the unmet needs of researchers in other regions, increases access to a wide variety of specimen types.
Repositories that bank tissues are subject to certain constraints because they store tissue using current technology, which can make it difficult to plan for future technologies. Because CHTN is not a bank, it is not limited by these constraints.
The CHTN Coordinating Committee, made up of the principal investigator of each regional division, an additional member from each division, and a representative from NCI, formulates policies for the operation of CHTN. This committee meets pe- riodically to assess the operation of CHTN and to change or modify operating policies.
CHTN takes feedback from its users seriously. A feedback ques- tionnaire is enclosed with each shipment, allowing the researcher to provide rapid feedback about the quality of that particular shipment. This information helps highlight any problems and allows CHTN to address them immediately. A more detailed questionnaire is sent annually to researchers who receive tissue from CHTN. The information collected in this annual evalua-
CHTN actively participates in national discussions of legal and ethical issues related to the collection and use of human bio- specimens for research purposes.
The TARP laboratory, located at NCI, receives paraffin-embedded tissues from CHTN and uses them to produce tissue microarrays that are distributed to researchers through the CHTN Eastern Division. The TARP laboratory is also involved in many collaborative research efforts for which collaborators provide specialized tissues for incorpo- ration into tissue microarrays. Approximately 60 percent of the tissue microarrays distributed by TARP are distributed to academic re- searchers, approximately 20 percent go to NIH researchers, and ap- proximately 20 percent go to private industry researchers. TARP’s bioinformatics system is primarily used for repository management purposes, but it is designed to be a research tool and is used as such for some of the collaborative studies. TARP follows the guidelines of CHTN when it comes to privacy, ethical and consent issues, with one exception: It does not require IRB approval for the use of its ar- rays, because the arrays are made from unlinked tissue (i.e., tissue not linked to any personally identifying information about the tissue source, anonymized) and are therefore exempt. TARP has concluded that its tissue microarrays are not patentable because the microarrays are functionally a single- or limited-use reagent with no inherent in- tellectual property value. TARP actively markets its resource, but has no communication with or education activities for tissue sources after they have contributed tissue. Other relevant findings at TARP are:
TARP produces and distributes multitumor tissue microarrays for cancer researchers and is at the center of developing related technology for use in high-throughput screening of DNA, RNA, and protein targets in multiple tumor tissues using immuno- histochemical, in situ hybridization, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis.
TARP arrays contain approximately 500 tissue samples, whereas arrays available from commercial businesses usually contain only 80 to 100 tissue samples. TARP arrays also contain smaller cores and a much higher density of tissue samples than commercially available arrays do, and they cost significantly less. (TARP charges academic researchers $40 per slide and commercial re- searchers $120 per slide; commercially available arrays can cost
EDRN is a collection of over 40 primarily academic research centers and a dozen private industry partners that facilitates collaborative re- search to link the discovery of biomarkers directly to the next steps of developing early detection tests. Collection, processing, and annota- tion of specimens and data reporting are all standardized. The com- bined repository of all the participants is available through the net- work. EDRN is funded through NCI and conducts “just in time” specimen collection based on the research needs. Privacy, ethical, and consent issues must be addressed and IRB approved prior to a re- search study being funded. The study investigators own any resulting intellectual property rights. EDRN actively markets at conferences and in journals. Other findings of interest are that:
EDRN represents a good example of collaborative research, the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. EDRN’s business model of a virtual repository enhances sample availability and information sharing among researchers. The specimens it counts in its collection are stored at geographically dispersed collection sites, but the data and information regarding these specimens are maintained centrally.
The participants of EDRN agree to a standardized method of collection and reporting. Therefore, each network participant has access to the database of all the other participants for the purposes of furthering cancer research.
Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry is part of the Breast and Ovarian CFRs, an NCI-funded network of international registries that collects extensive epidemiological medical data and biospecimens from breast and ovarian cancer patients and their families. The CFRs are collecting and banking blood and tumor specimens for use in epi- demiological and genetic research. Virtually all of the specimens col- lected by the CFRs are used by academic researchers. Biospecimens are collected by the CFRs with specific informed consent for partici- pation in the registries, and researchers are required to have IRB ap- proval for research that uses CFR resources. Unlike several of the other repositories, the CFR sites retain custody of and have primary rights to data generated through the use of CFR resources. This is primarily through collaborative agreements between CFR researchers and other academic researchers. The CFRs market their resources primarily through word of mouth, their Web site, and a brochure developed by NCI. The CFRs communicate with individuals who participate in the registries through a newsletter, distributed every four months, that summarizes research by the registries and an- nounces new research projects. The CFRs also inform participants of any clinically relevant test results that may be performed with their tissues. Other interesting aspects of Philadelphia Familial Breast Can- cer Registry and the Breast and Ovarian CFRs are:
Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry collects a great deal of clinical and epidemiological data from both patients and their families. It also collects longitudinal data from registry partici- pants.
The steering committee is the official governing body of the Breast and Ovarian CFRs. This committee is responsible for de- veloping the core protocols for biospecimen collection, the core instruments for the collection of epidemiological and clinical data, and policies and procedures.
The Breast and Ovarian CFRs also have an advisory board, which is an independent, multidisciplinary panel of senior can- cer researchers that evaluates researcher requests for use of the
registries’ resources. This committee makes recommendations on research priorities to the steering committee, which ratifies the recommendations based on the feasibility of providing the requested resources.
The Breast and Ovarian CFRs also have a publications working group that oversees all issues associated with publications.
The Informatics Center at the University of California at Irvine serves as a centralized data resource for the six member registries. It designed the bioinformatics system, provides guidelines for data standardization and specimen anonymization, and imple- ments network and database security, such as password protec- tion, encryption, and firewalls.
NHLBI maintains primarily blood and some tissue specimens as part of several studies. Tissue is distributed to government institutions and academic researchers. The bioinformatics system at the storage reposi- tory is used for repository management only, but the tissue data bio- informatics systems maintained by the Data Coordinating Center are capable of sophisticated statistical analysis. Privacy, ethical, and con- sent issues are determined by the study protocol, but they are care- fully overseen by IRBs in all cases, and by specific committees for each study. The specimens and intellectual property belong to NHLBI. For the LAM (Lymphangioleiomyomatosis) study, market- ing is primarily done through word of mouth because of the small target population; however, there is also some outreach at scientific meetings. Other relevant findings for NHLBI are:
The LAM Registry has a specific plan for recruiting tissue sources. The LAM Registry’s close contacts with medical facili- ties associated with the registry and trained staff are good models for standardization. In addition, the LAM Registry has devel- oped a consent template that participating centers can reformat according to the needs of their institution.
BBI Biotech has outstanding quality control, testing, and stan- dardization for shipping, data entry, and specimen storage.
clinical outcomes or outside research using the samples. The reposi- tory is not involved in consent issues that arise at the time of the sur- gery. IRB and tissue utilization committees deal with privacy and ethical issues related to tissue use and distribution. In addition to ad- vertising at national meetings, AFIP produces a newsletter six times a year that has a broad distribution to 17,000 pathologists, 5,000 of whom are outside the United States. AFIP also produces both an an- nual report and an annual research progress report. AFIP is currently developing a new business and marketing plan. Other findings of sig- nificance are:
AFIP has the single largest and most comprehensive collection of pathology material in the world. The sheer magnitude (more than 90 million specimens) and age (dating back to 1864) of AFIP’s specimen collection, as well as the wealth of information that has been collected about the specimens at AFIP, make these specimens valuable as historical controls and for ascertaining changes over time.
AFIP has good quality control and standardization given the va- riety of specimens it receives. Each specimen is checked against its associated data and identification number by three different people. In addition, there is a standard protocol for the proc- essing and storage of each specimen.
AFIP has the capability to provide samples accompanied by a wide array of information.
Duke University, which operates one of the NCI-funded SPOREs for breast cancer research, is funded through a Specialized Center Grant (P50) from NCI. Duke University Breast SPORE collects specimens
from patients at the Duke medical facility. It collects specimens for banking, as well as prospectively based upon specific research needs. The majority of its specimens (80 percent) are used for academic re- search. A smaller portion (20 percent) is used for government re- search. The Duke University Breast SPORE bioinformatics system is used primarily to catalog and track specimens in the repository; it was not designed for highly advanced searches. Duke University Breast SPORE trains its personnel in obtaining informed consent. It does not require IRB approval from outside requesters of unlinked (i.e., anonymized) samples, nor does it have a claim on intellectual prop- erty rights for samples it provides to others, although it does maintain such rights on any collaborative research in which it engages. Duke University Breast SPORE does not market itself. A novel procedure developed at Duke University Breast SPORE is as follows:
Duke University Breast SPORE developed a new protocol to collect breast tissue because of increased difficulty obtaining siz- able amounts of tissue given more focused breast surgeries (e.g., small lumpectomies). It developed a method of extracting a core from limited resection (e.g., lumpectomy) specimens without af- fecting the diagnostic ability of surgical pathologists.
Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, which is funded through a Specialized Center Grant (P50) from NCI, performs both prospective tissue col- lection and banking. It collects tissue from two Mayo hospitals and distributes 90 to 95 percent of that tissue to Mayo researchers. It uses a Microsoft Access® database that includes scanned H&amp;E stained slides to manage the repository. The Access® database can be cross- referenced with a clinical database. Full informed consent for the collection of tissue is obtained within 24 hours after surgery, and full IRB approval is required from researchers who request tissue. For tis- sue to be released outside of Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, a materi- als transfer agreement needs to be completed. Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE does not perform any marketing of its repository. Other in- teresting findings are:
Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE does not provide any testing or preparation of tissue. However, because it is centrally located near other “core” facilities, if a researcher requests DNA or RNA preparations, it works with the researcher and the other core fa- cilities to provide that service.
Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE collects longitudinal data and bodily fluids on all patients getting a radical prostatectomy. This includes pre-operative, operative, and follow-up data obtained at clinical visits, through questionnaires, and through the referring physician, if necessary. The Mayo SPORE also collects serum and urine from prostate patients at 3- to 6-month intervals.
validation laboratories for EDRN and serves as the Southern Division of CHTN. The SPOREs are primarily involved in tissue banking for future use once clinical outcomes data become available. The bioin- formatics system used by the SPOREs is specifically for repository management purposes. Biospecimens are collected with specific in- formed consent for donation, and researchers are required to have IRB approval for research that uses the SPOREs’ resources. The SPOREs have no intellectual property position. Researchers sign an agreement to use the SPOREs’ resources and accept liability for the use of the resources in this agreement. The SPOREs only market their resources internally at UAB through conferences. Other findings of interest are:
The UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs collect high-quality tis- sue and associated data. They are able to collect some tissues from most patients within 15 minutes of availability from the operating room. They utilize patient questionnaires in associa- tion with a bioinformatics facility to collect demographic and
medical history, as well as familial history of cancer and other in- formation. They also collect clinical outcomes data through the tumor registry.
UAB Breast SPORE has collected tissue from approximately 700 breast cancers and 1,000 uninvolved breasts, and UAB Ovarian SPORE has collected tissue from approximately 500 ovarian cancers and 1,000 uninvolved ovaries. However, they have not begun distributing many samples from these collec- tions, because they are allowing time for the resource to ma- ture—that is, they are trying to minimize use until there are enough longitudinal data for follow-up. The UAB SPOREs have found that it usually takes about four to five years for a tis- sue collection to “mature” to the point that there are enough follow-up data to be useful.
University of Pittsburgh HSTB was established in 1991. It performs both prospective tissue collection and banking of resected tumors from the prostate, gastrointestinal tract, lung, liver, breast, head and neck, gynecological sites, muscle, and skin. University of Pittsburgh HSTB distributes over 90 percent of its tissue to UPMC researchers. Its OSD integration engine automatically integrates the tissue bank inventory system, the pathology report, and the cancer registry sys- tem. It also includes results from DNA microarray experiments and is both minable and Web based. The repository is primarily publicly funded. It has IRB approval to collect tissue, and the tissue sources are consented prior to and separate from the surgery. Researchers re- questing samples are required to have IRB approval of their research. Intellectual property rights for research on the tissue belong to the institutions performing the research (primarily UPMC). University of Pittsburgh HSTB advertises by word of mouth, Web sites, an exhibit at an annual meeting of cancer researchers, and an annual meeting on pathology informatics that it hosts in Pittsburgh. Other findings of interest at University of Pittsburgh HSTB are:
The University of Pittsburgh HSTB tissue collection includes a wide variety of tissue: cancerous tissue, non-diseased matching adjacent tissue, metastatic tumore (through the Warm Autopsy Program, from patients who consent before passing away), nor- mal tissue from patients who have donated their organs for transplant and research, and blood products.
The University of Pittsburgh HSTB OSD integration engine integrates multiple data systems. It automatically pulls de- identified information from the surgical pathology report, in- cludes longitudinal and outcomes data from the cancer registry, and includes genomic data. All of this is searchable via the Web.
The University of Pittsburgh HSTB OSD integration engine is the basis for the Pennsylvania Cancer Alliance Bioinformatics Consortium, a partnership comprising six institutes in Pennsyl- vania that are sharing tissue resources and data to enhance translational and clinical cancer research. The consortium is de- veloping a statewide data model for bioinformatics and a state- wide repository of serum and tissue specimens.
University of Pittsburgh HSTB stores tissues in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen at –134˚C to –170˚C, which, according to UPMC researchers, maintains the genomic integrity better than storage at –80˚C does.
University of Pittsburgh Research Informatics (as well as the in- formation technology group) is integrated with the scientists, making the system very user friendly and information friendly. It is in constant support of growth and integration.
Ardais is a private company that began operations in 1999. The com- pany grew out of a mutual interest between researchers at Duke Medical Center and Ardais founders to develop a tissue/data banking resource for Duke and the greater research community. Ardais per- forms standardized collection and banking of tissues and distributes its tissue specimens to the four contributing institutes, other aca- demic researchers, and private industry. The Ardais bioinformatics system, BIGR™, includes pathology data, is used for repository man-
agement, and is searchable by researchers requesting tissue. Ardais is primarily privately funded. Informed consent from tissue sources is obtained specifically for the collection of tissue specimens for research purposes. The company has IRB approval to collect tissues, and IRB approval—either from the requester’s IRB or the Ardais IRB—is re- quired to request tissues. Ardais does not have a formal intellectual property policy. Marketing takes place through scientific meetings, word of mouth, and a seminar series Ardais sponsors on clinical ge- nomics. Other relevant findings at Ardais are:
Ardais’s tissue procurement system, with pathology assistants working in each hospital, ensures that Ardais gets as many tissue samples as possible.
Ardais’s quality assurance system is state of the art. All specimens are bar coded and scanned. Inventory lists, including incoming specimens, samples being used for quality assurance, and out- going samples, are computerized. All personnel working with tissue use scanning guns when adding information to the BIGR™ database for the tissue.
Ardais’s laboratory offers a wide variety of services with its tissue (DNA/RNA/protein preparations, tissue microassay, laser cap- ture microdissection, and immunohistochemistry) and is con- stantly working on developing new services.
Ardais’s information technology group is well integrated with the scientists, making the BIGR™ system user and information friendly.
GCI was established in 1998, primarily as a for-profit private biotechnology research company. GCI has a fee-for-service side (~65 percent of its business) that works primarily with the pharma- ceutical industry to design and collect specimens for drug develop- ment. It also participates in larger collaborative research programs with pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, and academic and government institutions. The GCI bioinformatics system serves as a repository management tool and as a database of research results.
GCI trains coordinators to obtain informed consent from tissue sources. Tissue specimens are collected with identifiable information, but the link between the specimen and the patient is permanently destroyed. For blood and serum specimens, the link between the specimen and the patient is kept by a third party. The intellectual property rights belong to the customer on the fee-for-service side and are shared among collaborators on the research side. GCI engages in a minimal amount of marketing at conferences and through some journals. Other findings of interest at GCI are:
GCI has created an impressive bioinformatics system (the Laboratory Information Management System, or LIMS) that is a state-of-the-art “cradle to grave” sample and data tracking sys- tem.
GCI has multiple quality assurance procedures in place (e.g., every tube and slide in the collection kit has the same bar code, and additional bar code stickers are supplied to be attached to any accompanying paperwork). Bar codes on all the specimens are scanned once they arrive at GCI, and laboratory technicians check for any inconsistencies.
GCI employs two pathologists that review every specimen col- lection kit that arrives. The pathologists are able to check for the quality of specimens collected and the accuracy of their prepara- tion. The pathologists verify the diagnosis and add any further annotation deemed necessary.
GCI follows strict ethical standards. It created a bioethics advi- sory board that includes nationally recognized bioethics experts. The board helped GCI develop its operating procedures and meets four times a year to review procedures and recommend any necessary adjustments. GCI uses a third-party system for pa- tient information that allows for longitudinal patient follow-up while maintaining several firewalls of protection for patient identity.
The sequencing of the human genome and recent advances in ge- nomic and proteomic research have improved the understanding of the biology of cancer and have resulted in new ways to prevent, diag- nose, and treat cancer. The use of biospecimens has been key to the discovery of many of these advances in cancer care.
These valuable biospecimens and associated data are collected and stored at hundreds of tissue repositories in the United States. However, there are currently no national standards in place for tissue repositories that collect and store specimens for use in research.1 Therefore, the way one repository collects, processes, and stores its specimens may be very different from that of another repository, which may complicate comparisons of research results obtained using biospecimens from different repositories. The quality and the extent of clinical information collected with the specimens also vary from repository to repository. In addition, the type of informed consent obtained from many of the tissue sources of these specimens is not sufficiently robust to allow the use of these specimens in research that requires long-term follow-up of clinically relevant data. Furthermore, once samples are distributed to researchers, most repositories do not require those researchers to report research results back to the reposi- tory, and even fewer repositories enter those research results into their bioinformatics systems and make them available to the broader re- search community.
The NBN Design Team recognized the limitations of existing repositories and concluded that the development of a nationally co- ordinated, standardized, high-quality tissue resource and data bank
1 Professional societies, such as the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories (ISBER) and the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS), have recognized the need for standardization and are developing guidance for establishing and operating biospecimen repositories. ISBER is creating a set of Best Practices for Repositories to provide repository professionals with guidance on repository activities. The NCCLS guidelines will cover all health care institutions and clinics that collect human tissue for research purposes, and will provide standards for addressing all issues associated with the collection of human tissue to support biomedical research, including the ethical, legislative, and legal concerns.
was necessary for the nation to ultimately realize the promise of ge- nomics and proteomics for preventing and curing cancer and other diseases. The NBN Design Team envisioned a network of geographi- cally dispersed tissue repositories to collect, process, store, and dis- tribute appropriately consented diseased and normal tissue and other biological specimens with associated clinical data supported and co- ordinated by an accessible, user-friendly bioinformatics system net- worked across the country. The biospecimens would be collected, processed, annotated, stored, and distributed in a highly standardized manner to minimize experimental variability and accelerate scientific progress. The NBN would also contain research data submitted by investigators who use NBN samples.
Based on an evaluation of existing human tissue resources at twelve tissue repositories, RAND found best practices that the NBN Design Team and the TAWG may want to consider as they imple- ment their plan for the NBN. The following sections summarize the combination of best practices required to build a robust resource for genomics- and proteomics-based research.
The network of geographically dispersed tissue repositories to collect, process, annotate, store, and distribute tissue envisioned by the NBN Design Team is very similar to how some of the repositories evaluated for this study are set up. CHTN, EDRN, the Breast and Ovarian CFRs (of which Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry is a member), and University of Pittsburgh HSTB are all variations of the model of a network of geographically dispersed tissue repositories with decentralized collection, storage, and distribution. NHLBI, AFIP, Ardais, and GCI have a decentralized collection model but maintain storage and distribution of samples at one physical location. TARP also has a decentralized collection model with its bioinformat- ics system and storage maintained at one physical location, but TARP tissue microarrays are distributed to users by CHTN Eastern Divi- sion. In contrast, Duke University Breast SPORE, Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE, and the UAB Breast and Ovarian SPOREs have
centralized collection, storage, and distribution. Best practices in the areas of biospecimen collection, processing, annotation, storage, and distribution were observed at all of these repositories.
Best Practices for Biospecimen Collection. Several repositories have established networks of collection sites at academic medical centers and community hospitals to obtain the number and variety of high- quality samples and associated data needed by researchers. Reposito- ries are also collecting tissue from ethnically diverse populations of all ages and from countries other than the United States to ensure the diversity of tissues available for research purposes. In addition to col- lecting tissues from a broad range of diseases, including cancer, diabe- tes, and vascular, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases, repositories are collecting non-diseased matching adjacent tissue, normal tissue (from autopsy, organ donation, or patients undergoing surgery for a different condition), and blood and blood components for compari- son to diseased tissue. These best practices for biospecimen collec- tion will increase the number and variety of high-quality samples with appropriate normal controls that are demographically represen- tative of the population. (For details on best practices for biospeci- men collection practiced by each repository see Table 10.2.)
All of the repositories utilize pathologists to determine what tis- sue is necessary for pathologic diagnosis and what is excess and avail- able to give to the repository for storage and research use. The pa- thologist takes what is necessary for patient treatment and diagnosis and immediately gives the remainder to trained repository personnel who begin the sample preservation protocol. At all of the repositories, patient care and the pathological diagnosis have absolute priority over the use of any specimen in research. The prioritization of patient di- agnosis over collection of specimens for research purposes and the use of pathologists to initially procure the portion of the specimen des- tined for the repository are best practices that will ensure that patient care is not compromised and that patients continue to donate bio- specimens.
Most of the repositories utilize repository personnel or collection-site personnel (pathology assistants, tissue technicians, histotechnologists) who are specifically trained by the repository to collect and process biospecimens. In addition, many of the reposito- ries have developed their own SOPs for biospecimen collection and preparation that are established uniformly at all collecting sites. Repository-trained personnel are provided with these standardized protocols to follow for the collection and processing of biospecimens. In addition, some repositories use standardized collection kits that are given to all sites for the collection and processing of biospecimens. Using repository-trained personnel for the collection and processing of biospecimens, and developing SOPs and providing standard collec- tion and processing equipment for those personnel to use are best practices that will promote standardized tissue collection and proc- essing.
Some of the repositories employ a bar-coding system to track every specimen and its associated information from the time of collec- tion through the time of distribution. Each specimen vial, storage box, and associated pathology report is bar coded and logged into the bioinformatics system. The use of scannable bar codes or other elec- tronic technology to track biospecimens and associated information throughout their lifetime at the repository is a best practice.
Best Practices for Biospecimen Processing and Annotation. At most of the repositories, pathologists are responsible for verification and evaluation of biospecimens collected by the repository. The patholo- gist confirms the identity and diagnosis of the specimen by matching the tissue received with the pathology report and other documents provided and reviewing an H&amp;E stained slide made from each specimen. Results and annotations gathered from tests performed on the specimens upon arrival and throughout the life of the specimen at the repository are linked to the specimens at all repositories evaluated for this study. At some repositories, any additional information about the specimen obtained through the quality control histopathologic examination is provided to researchers, and digital images of stained slides are posted to the database for examination by researchers. The
verification and evaluation by a pathologist of biospecimens collected by the repository is a best practice to ensure that high-quality speci- mens are procured. (For details on best practices for biospecimen processing and annotation practiced by each repository see Table 10.3.)
Best practices for data collection depend on the mission of the repository. Collections of biospecimens used primarily by basic re- searchers may only require minimal associated clinical data, such as demographic data and pathology reports. Biospecimens collected for translational research (e.g., target identification or validation) may require more in-depth associated clinical data, such as medical and family histories, treatment, and clinical outcomes data. No matter what the requirements for the amount of associated data are, certain best practices are applicable. Collecting consistent and high-quality data associated with biospecimens and employing a standardized set of common data elements that are collected with every biospecimen are best practices. In addition to collecting basic demographic and pathologic data, some repositories collect extensive data on family history, medical history, lifestyle and diet history, treatment, and clinical outcomes. Collecting complete data on all elements in a minimal data set designed to fulfill the mission of the repository and meet the needs of its users is a best practice.
The repositories that collect longitudinal data do so through an- nual questionnaires or tumor registries or directly from hospital medical records. Tissue sources are informed during the consent process that they will be asked to fill out a questionnaire or that in- formation from their medical records will be obtained in the future. Each of these methods has its limitations. Annual questionnaires sent to tissue sources rely on self-reporting by the tissue source. Tumor registries and hospitals routinely lose track of tissue sources due to high rates of mobility of some patients. The ability to effectively col- lect and store longitudinal data is a best practice.
Use pathologists to verify and evaluate biospecimens
Once data are collected, they must be entered into the reposi- tory’s bioinformatics system. Some of the repositories have developed procedures for ensuring accurate data entry. Some collect common data elements and use standardized terminology for data collection procedures, which allows for the creation of data-entry forms com- plete with drop-down menus and other features that minimize the error introduced while typing information into forms. Others use automated methods, such as parsing techniques, to flag discrepancies and keep records of when error tracking and reconciliation are done. Ensuring the accuracy of data entry through the use of standardized terminology and computer data-entry forms (e.g., drop-down menus) whenever possible is a best practice.
Best Practices for Biospecimen Storage and Distribution. Several re- positories have developed standards for storage depending on tissue type and preservation condition (e.g., snap frozen, paraffin embed- ded, tissue microarray). Snap-frozen specimens are commonly stored at –80°C in mechanical freezers or in liquid nitrogen. Paraffin- embedded tissue and tissue microarrays are stored at room tempera- ture under conditions that will protect them from melting or other damage. However, there is no consensus on the optimum storage conditions for specimens. Some repositories use bar-coded inventory systems to track specimen location. Establishing standard operating procedures for biospecimen storage and using a bar-coding inventory system are best practices for ensuring that specimens are stored ap- propriately and are accessible for distribution when necessary. (For details on best practices for biospecimen storage and distribution practiced by each repository see Table 10.4.)
Once specimens are placed in storage, it is necessary to monitor storage conditions and maintain equipment in good working order. Most repositories utilize a monitored central alarm system, have backup generators or liquid nitrogen backup, and maintain enough empty freezer space to allow for quick transfer of specimens from malfunctioning freezers. Some repositories have developed standard operating procedures specifically for the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly maintenance procedures, and have maintenance agreements
with professional periodic maintenance. Some repositories even util- ize multiple storage locations, which can be on site (i.e., specimens are divided between two or more freezers), on site and offsite, or in a network of storage facilities. Standard operating procedures for freezer maintenance, adequate backup equipment, and redundancy in stor-
age location are best practices to ensure that specimens are stored and maintained at the necessary temperature and condition and that specimen integrity is not compromised.
Some repositories do periodic checks of specimen integrity (e.g., examining new histology slides and testing RNA integrity), while others review and verify pathology reports to ensure that the bio- specimen fulfills the researcher’s request. Utilizing standardized storage techniques and periodically auditing, inventorying, and certi- fying the location, identity, and quality of specimens are best prac- tices that will ensure the quality and integrity of samples sent to researchers.
Some repositories use standardized and carefully monitored shipping procedures that are integrated with the repository’s bioin- formatics system to track all shipments in and out of the repository. Biospecimens sent to the repository from remote/satellite sites and samples sent from the repository to researchers are tracked using a bar-coded inventory system. Using standardized and carefully moni- tored shipping procedures with systems to track all shipments and expected receipts is a best practice.
Specimen distribution practices clearly depend on the mission of the repository. If the mission is to provide tissue samples to as broad a researcher base as possible based on the quality of the proposed re- search, then biospecimen distribution policies should be established to fulfill this mission. If the mission is clearly defined and the reposi- tory evaluates its ability to meet its goals, and changes policies, proce- dures, and practices when it is not meeting its goals, then this is a best practice.
Quality Assurance and Standardization of Biospecimen Collection, Processing, Annotation, Storage, and Distribution. Quality assurance is fundamental to the successful operation of any repository that col- lects, processes, annotates, stores, and distributes biospecimens for research purposes. The use of standardized protocols for collection, storage, processing, and distribution of specimens, and common data elements for the annotation of specimens at each of the individual
network participant locations makes comparative research across par- ticipating institutions possible and is a best practice.
and distribution of biospecimens occur at consistently high levels of quality, it is necessary to have a multitiered, fully integrated system of quality assurance (including quality control) and standard operating procedures. Quality assurance starts with training of personnel before biospecimens are ever collected and includes everything up through considering researcher feedback on sample quality. Some of the best practices of quality assurance and standardization for biospecimen collection, processing, annotation, storage, and distribution observed at the repositories evaluated for this study are:
Train all personnel who are involved in the collection, process- ing, annotation, storage, and distribution of tissue.
Standardize collection, processing, annotation, storage, and dis- tribution protocols to ensure the highest quality samples and comparability of research results.
Perform appropriate quality control testing on each specimen, such as histopathology (H&amp;E), immunohistochemistry, testing for DNA/RNA integrity, or other quality control testing as ap- propriate.
Bar code all specimens and data so it is easy both to match the specimen with the pathology report and other associated data and to locate the specimen in the storage facility.
Use researcher feedback about sample quality to re-examine quality control procedures.
The NBN Design Team noted that a bioinformatics system should be standardized, scalable and secure, and appropriate for program management, data aggregation, tissue acquisition and management, and data analysis. These characteristics were observed to varying de- grees in the bioinformatics systems of the repositories evaluated. All of the repositories used their bioinformatics systems for repository management; however, very few of the repositories fed research re-
sults back into the database, and none of the repositories shared its data publicly. (For details on best practices for bioinformatics prac- ticed by each repository see Table 10.5.)
The bioinformatics systems at the repositories ranged from sim- ple Microsoft Access® databases to internally developed proprietary systems. Most repositories established close ties among the bioinfor- matics system developers, the researchers, the data managers, and repository management. This is a best practice that allows the bio- informatics system to be designed so that it is responsive to the needs of multiple types of users.
Feed research results back into system for access by researchers
Several repositories use a standardized language to categorize and describe biospecimens and enter data into the bioinformatics system. The repositories were also using various techniques to ensure the ac- curacy of the data entered into the database. Some of the sites manu- ally double or triple check the data entered into their systems using independent technicians or researchers; other sites rely on automated software or random or requested checks to validate their data. In ad- dition, some of the databases were set up to allow the repository’s bioinformatics system to interface with the medical informatics sys- tem located at the collection site to automatically extract data. Using standardized language to categorize and describe biospecimens and enter data into the bioinformatics system is a best practice that will allow comparison of biospecimen characteristics among collection sites. In addition, using either an automated data extraction system or multiple checks of data entry is a best practice to ensure accuracy of the data in the bioinformatics system.
Only a few of the repositories currently feed data from research performed with their samples back into the repository data system, and fewer still collect genomics or proteomics data. A best practice for bioinformatics systems is feeding standard research results and genomics and proteomics results back into the system for other re- searchers to access.
All of the bioinformatics systems are searchable, and many data- bases are Web based. In some cases, researchers have access to some data; in others, data coordinating centers or other data managers re- tain sole access. A few of the bioinformatics systems were specifically created to allow data mining and advanced statistical analysis. A bio- informatics system that is searchable and minable via varying levels of Web-based access for different individuals (including repository per- sonnel, researchers, patients, and the public) is a best practice.
Most of the repositories exercise access control to their data, al- lowing researchers, physicians, and others to access limited data while maintaining strict control over the ability to manipulate the data. All of the repositories use both cyber and physical means to protect the data. Network security systems and access control are best practices
to ensure that privacy is protected and that the bioinformatics system is secure.
A repository is only successful if it is meeting its users’ needs. This involves continual self-assessment and re-evaluation. However, meeting user needs means different things to each repository and de- pends on the repository’s design, its customer profile, and its product offerings. Assessing the needs of researchers, tracking the numbers and types of tissue samples distributed, and using this information to quickly change collection priorities to match customer demand is a best practice. (For details on best practices for consumer/user needs practiced by each repository see Table 10.6.)
The review and prioritization system for tissue distribution at the repositories generally falls into one of four general categories: (1) first come, first served; (2) priority to members of the network, col- laborators, and/or contributors to the repository; (3) prioritization based on merit review of research proposals; or (4) prioritization based on a set policy of the repository. Some of the repositories use a tissue utilization committee to prioritize tissue distribution, especially for requests for large amounts of tissue and rare tissue. A few of the repositories also have policies to control the distribution of the last sample of a particular specimen and to prevent the control of an en- tire specimen or type of specimen by one researcher. Best practices to ensure equitable distribution of tissue to a large group of research- ers include the use of a tissue utilization committee to prioritize tissue distribution based on merit review of researcher proposals, and poli- cies to control the distribution of rare specimens, to control the last sample of a particular specimen, and to prevent the monopolization of an entire specimen or type of specimen by one researcher.
At some repositories, researchers at institutions that are collec- tion sites for the repositories receive some level of priority over other researchers for tissue distribution. Giving priority to researchers at collecting institutions is a best practice that leads to increased sup- port for the resource and higher investment in the quality of the specimens collected.
Committees or review groups in which both providers and con- sumers are able to provide input on the usefulness of the repository resources are valuable in evaluating how well the repository is meeting user needs. In addition, solicitation of direct researcher feedback on the quality of samples received helps to identify systemic problems, inconsistencies, or problems with specimens in the repository or specimens being collected in a certain way or from a certain collection
site. These best practices enable repositories to improve specimen quality and be responsive to researcher needs.
The repositories evaluated for this study are funded primarily by the federal government or the private sector and are located at federal agencies, academic institutions, and private companies. Different business models are represented among the repositories evaluated, including tissue banking versus prospective collection and distribu- tion, networks versus individual sites, and centralized versus decen- tralized collection, storage, and bioinformatics systems. Establishing a network of collection sites at academic medical centers and commu- nity hospitals to perform a combination of banking to collect and maintain a ready supply of tissue and prospective collection to meet researcher needs is a best practice. (For details on best practices for business plan and operations practiced by each repository see Table 10.7.)
Many of those interviewed indicated that when first beginning discussions with a medical facility about its becoming a participating collection site, it was more productive to talk with the pathologists and surgeons rather than the administrators. Ultimately, it is neces- sary to establish good working relationships with all levels of collec- tion site staff. Establishing and maintaining close working relation- ships with surgeons, pathologists, nurses, and other relevant staff at the collection sites is a best practice.
Most repositories did not know the cost to collect, process, store, and distribute samples, and the industry repositories declined to provide cost information. The few repositories that could provide cost estimates gave costs of between $60 and $150 per sample. Part of this price differential depends on the amount of clinical information accompanying the biospecimen—the more information, the higher the cost of collecting the tissue. Likewise, only a few repositories pro- vided information about the cost of samples to researchers. At these repositories, the price of samples ranged from free of charge to $200. Tissue microarrays ranged in price from $40 for academic researchers to $120 for industry researchers. Accurately determining the actual

aArdais and GCI declined to share the costs of repository operations. However, both repositories reported that they have accurately determined the costs of repository operation to financially sustain the repository.
costs of collecting, processing, storing, and distributing tissue samples to researchers, and operating on a cost recovery basis to financially sustain the repository is a best practice.
All the repositories that were evaluated claimed to constantly be on the lookout for new technologies that would improve their proc- esses. Some have regular meetings with staff to brainstorm the issue; others have more formal mechanisms, such as committees or work- shops established to purposefully scan for improvements and new technologies. Continually assessing new technologies and taking
measures to develop and incorporate new technologies into the re- pository is a best practice.
All of the repositories request acknowledgment in publications if their resource is used in research, although few have actual require- ments. At the academic-based and industry repositories, acknowl- edgment of the repository is requested but not required; at most of the government repositories, acknowledgment is contractually re- quired and specific wording is suggested. Requiring acknowledgment of the repository, including specific language, is a best practice be- cause it raises the visibility of the resource and may encourage future donations and use of the resource.
Some repositories keep identifiable information on tissue sources at the collection sites rather than at the main repository site. All of the repositories that keep identifiable information on site generally limit access to identifiable information to select staff. A few repositories use the “honest broker” model, which uses a neutral intermediary, be- tween the individual whose tissue and data are being studied and the researcher, to collect and collate pertinent information regarding the tissue source, replace identifiers with a code, and release only coded information to the researcher. Limiting access to the codes that link patients’ identifying information to their tissue specimens through physical and/or cyber procedures is a best practice to ensure that pa- tient privacy and confidentiality are protected. (For details on best practices for privacy, ethical concerns, and consent issues practiced by each repository see Table 10.8.)
IRBs are responsible for the oversight and review of research that involves human participants to ensure that their privacy is protected and data confidentiality is maintained. All of the repositories evalu- ated use an IRB to oversee the repository practices, and most of them require researchers requesting samples to have IRB approval for their research. Some of the repositories also rely on separate bioethics advi- sory boards or committees to oversee privacy and confidentiality pro- cedures. Requiring repositories to have IRB approval for the collec- tion, storage, and distribution of biospecimens and associated data,
Privacy, Ethical Concerns, and Consent Issues
and requiring researchers requesting samples to have IRB approval of the research projects that will use the samples are best practices. Having a bioethics advisory board or other governance and oversight board/committee to oversee privacy and confidentiality procedures is a best practice that provides another layer of review.
At all of the repositories evaluated where specific informed con- sent is obtained for the collection of biospecimens, it is obtained separately from the surgical consent. Some repositories use a tiered consent process that allows individuals to choose the type of speci- men(s), if any, they want to donate (e.g., tissue, blood, or urine), the type of research for which the specimen(s) may be used (e.g., a spe- cific research project, general research, or genetic research), and whether their medical records and outcomes data can be accessed and appended to the specimen for use in research. Obtaining biospeci- mens from individuals who are fully informed about and have con- sented to the collection of their tissue by the repository and its use for research purposes, and using a tiered consent process are best prac- tices. Ideally, the consent process should occur separately from the surgical consent. However, since this is not always possible, at a minimum the informed consent for the collection and research use of specimens should be a separate section of the surgical consent form that requires a separate signature.
Individuals who contribute biospecimens must have the right to withdraw their consent and have their tissue removed from the re- pository, a requirement for all federally funded research in the federal regulations governing research with human participants. However, in cases were the tissue has been stripped of identifiers and the link back to the tissue source has been destroyed, it is not possible to retrieve the tissue to withdraw it from the repository. Not only should the tissue be removed from the repository, but all data and computer re- cords should be destroyed. Beyond the right to withdraw their tissue and data from the repository, tissue sources are given no other rights to their tissues by most repositories. It is a best practice to allow an individual who contributes tissue to a repository to withdraw consent and have the tissue, data, and computer records removed from the repository if the tissue retains identifiers to link it to that individual and it has not already been distributed to researchers. (For details on best practices for intellectual property and legal issues practiced by each repository see Table 10.9.)
The majority of repositories do not retain downstream rights to any intellectual property produced through the use of the tissue they distribute, with the exception of collaborative research, in which case the intellectual property rights are shared. The Cancer Family Regis- tries sites do retain custody of and have primary rights to their data. Some repositories have no specific policies on intellectual policy for the distribution of biospecimens. To promote clarity, prevent poten- tial legal confusion, and avoid conflicts with tissue sources, research- ers using the tissue, and institutions contributing biospecimens, a
In most cases, institutions that contribute biospecimens to the repository give up their rights to the biospecimens as well. However, some contributing institutions are given priority for tissue requests. A best practice is to prioritize tissue distribution based on need while reserving a small percentage of tissue for contributing institutions par- ticipating in the repository.
Most of the repositories require researchers to sign some kind of agreement for the use of tissue that covers the legal issues associated with the use of biospecimens from their repositories. These tissue use agreements usually contain language to the effect that the researcher agrees that the specimens will be used only for the purposes cited in the application, no attempt to obtain identifying information will be made, no specimens will be sold or shared with a third party without the prior written permission of the repository, all specimens will be treated as potentially infectious, all personnel who will be handling the specimens will be properly trained, there is no implied warranty on the specimens; any publications resulting from the use of reposi- tory specimens will acknowledge the repository, and the re- searcher/institution using the tissue assumes responsibility for all risks associated with the receipt, handling, storage, and use of the tissue. The use of a tissue use agreement is a best practice.
None of the repositories have experienced liability issues re- garding safety issues associated with the use of the specimens, loss of privacy or breach of confidentiality of tissue sources, claims by tissue sources of physical/psychosocial harms, or claims by tissue sources to property rights for discoveries made using their tissue. Even so, it is a best practice to explicitly specify the responsibility for assuming risks in connection with use of biospecimens in tissue use agreements, to fully inform tissue sources about risks to their rights and welfare, and to clarify ownership issues during the informed consent process. Similarly, it is a best practice to carefully review researcher submis- sions and credentials to ensure that tissue is being used by legitimate researchers for legitimate purposes. This review should include the inspection of IRB documentation, review of the study design for
Public relations, marketing, and education are critical to the success of any tissue repository. The repositories evaluated use a combination of approaches to increase the visibility of their resource and mission, including exhibits at scientific meetings, advertising in scientific jour- nals, newsletters, Web sites, direct mailings, and word of mouth. Some of the smaller repositories at universities do not market their resources at all. Using a combination of approaches to advertise the resources available at the repository is a best practice. (For details on best practices for public relations, marketing, and education practiced by each repository see Table 10.10.)
workshops that report generalized research findings, disseminating research news and patient education information on a Web site, and sending newsletters to tissue sources and researchers summarizing re- search with repository resources. Although not widely done today, a best practice for repositories is to provide feedback to tissue sources and physicians about generalized findings from research with reposi- tory resources, through the Internet, sessions at scientific meetings, newsletters, or other outreach venues.
Each of the repositories evaluated in this study was designed accord- ing to a specific vision, which was not necessarily the same as the vi- sion of the NBN Design Team. Due to these different visions, none of the repositories in this report exhibit all of the elements identified as important by the NBN Design Team for the proposed NBN. However, in most cases the repositories are flexible and, with appro- priate funding and guidelines, have the potential to be an integral part of the NBN. In fact, this study revealed that most of the reposi- tories have undergone a significant learning curve and that their cur- rent successes are based on years of experience and learning from early operations. This wealth of experience should not be overlooked as NDC goes forward with its plan to establish a new NBN.
All of the repositories exhibit some characteristics that would be useful for an NBN, but some of the repositories incorporate more of the NBN Design Team requirements than others do. CHTN, Uni- versity of Pittsburgh HSTB, Ardais, and GCI have several of the characteristics identified by the NBN Design Team as necessary for a successful NBN. CHTN is a virtual network with the proven ability to distribute tens of thousands of biospecimens in a variety of forms (e.g., fresh, snap frozen, and paraffin embedded) to meet researchers’ needs. University of Pittsburgh HSTB has developed a Web-based bioinformatics system that includes proteomics and genomics infor- mation and is already being used in Pennsylvania to create a virtual
network of repositories. Ardais and GCI, the two private companies included in this study, have streamlined their specimen collection, processing, storage, and distribution through specific standard oper- ating procedures, and they both minimize operator and data entry errors through the use of bar-code systems.
Other repositories have only a few of the key components of the proposed NBN. For example, TARP develops and disseminates tissue microarrays for high-throughput screening of multiple-tumor tissue (300 to 500 tissue specimens per array). EDRN requires that speci- mens be collected, processed, and annotated in a standardized man- ner and that a set of common data elements be collected with each specimen. Philadelphia Familial Breast Cancer Registry also uses common data elements and routinely collects longitudinal data. The SPOREs at Duke University, Mayo Clinic, and UAB routinely col- lect detailed clinical information and longitudinal data.
Whether NDC decides to build a brand new repository or to use existing repositories in the development of the NBN, learning from the existing repositories will be an important step. This report identi- fies the best practices at twelve biospecimen repositories in the United States. As the NBN gets under way, more detailed analyses of existing biospecimen repositories and the inclusion of key personnel from ex- isting repositories will be warranted.

Bioinformatics. Research, development, or application of com- putational tools and approaches for expanding the use of biological, medical, behavioral, or health data, including those to acquire, store, organize, archive, analyze, or visualize such data (as defined by the NIH Biomedical Information Science and Technology Initiative Consortium; http://www.bisti.nih.gov/CompuBioDef.pdf).
Biospecimen. Includes everything from subcellular structures such as DNA, to cells, tissue (bone, muscle, connective tissue, and skin), organs (e.g., liver, bladder, heart, kidney), blood, gametes (sperm and ova), embryos, fetal tissue, and waste (urine, feces, sweat, hair and nail clippings, shed epithelial cells, placenta).
Case. When a patient enters the hospital for a biopsy or surgery, the resulting tissue is accessioned in the pathology department as a single case.
Coded samples . Samples and data supplied by repositories to re- searchers from identified tissues with a code rather than with person- ally identifying information (such as a name or Social Security num- ber). (Coded samples are sometimes called linked or identifiable.)
Data mining. Part of a larger process called knowledge discovery; specifically, the step in which advanced statistical analysis and mod- eling techniques are applied to the data to find useful patterns and relationships. Also, sorting through data to identify patterns and es- tablish relationships.
De-identified protected health information. Health informa- tion that does not identify an individual and with respect to which
there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual. Such information is not individually identifiable health information (45 C.F.R. §164.514(a)-(c)).
Genomics. The study of genes and their function; the study of all or a substantial portion of the genes of an organism as a dynamic system, over time, to determine how those genes interact and influ- ence biological pathways, networks, and physiology.
Honest broker. A neutral intermediary between the individual whose tissue and data are being studied and the researcher. The hon- est broker collects and collates pertinent information regarding the tissue source, replaces identifiers with a code, and releases only coded information to the researcher.
Identifiable. Tissue that is linked to personal information in such a way that the person from whom the material was obtained could be identified by name, patient number, or clear family relation- ship is considered identifiable.
Identified samples. Samples and data supplied by repositories from identified tissue with a personal identifier (such as a name or patient number) that would allow the researcher to link the biological information derived from the research directly to the individual from whom the material was obtained.
in silico. In or by means of a computer simulation; in a virtual environment, such as a computer simulation.
Matching adjacent tissue. Tissue collected during surgery that is next to the diseased tissue, but appears normal by virtual inspection under a microscope.
Minable. Data mining is part of a larger process called knowl- edge discovery; specifically, the step in which advanced statistical analysis and modeling techniques are applied to the data to find use- ful patterns and relationships.
Normal tissue. Non-diseased tissue from autopsy, organ dona- tion, or patients undergoing surgery for a condition other than the one under study; usually used for a control in experiments with dis- eased tissue.
Parsing technique. A process of determining the structure of in- put; a technique to compare the input file against a standard content.
Discrepancies between the input and the standard are flagged as er- rors. In linguistics, parsing means dividing language into small com- ponents that can be analyzed. Parsing a sentence involves breaking it into words and phrases and identifying each component’s type (e.g., verb, adjective, noun).
Proteomics. The study of the full set of proteins encoded by a genome; the study of the identities, quantities, structures, and bio- chemical and cellular functions of all proteins in an organism, organ, or organelle, and how these properties vary in space, time, and physiological state.
Quality assurance. A program for the systematic monitoring and evaluation of the various aspects of a project, service, or facility to ensure that standards of quality are being met.
Quality control. Activities designed to ensure adequate quality; the process of assuring that certain desired characteristics of a product are being attained.
Sample. When portions of specimens are distributed to re- searchers, the researcher is receiving a sample of that specimen.
Searchable. A database that can be queried by a researcher to de- termine whether certain samples with certain characteristics are avail- able is searchable.
Specimen. A portion of tissue, blood, or urine used for diagnosis and analysis. A single biopsy may generate several specimens, including a number of slides, paraffin blocks, and frozen specimens.
Tissue source. An individual from which a biospecimen is col- lected for research purposes. A tissue source may be an individual who has volunteered and has consented to participate in a clinical trial or other research project and to contribute tissue for research use, or an individual whose tissue that remains after medical treatment/ diagnosis or autopsy is used for research purposes for which consent has been waived.
Unidentifiable. Tissue for which identifiable information was not collected or, if collected, was not maintained and cannot be re- trieved by the repository.
Unidentified samples. Samples and data supplied by repositories to researchers from a collection of unidentified tissue (sometimes called anonymous).
Unlinked samples. Samples and data that lack identifiers or codes that can link them to an identified specimen or a particular human being (also called anonymized).
Volunteer. A person who has volunteered to participate in a clinical trial or other research project.
